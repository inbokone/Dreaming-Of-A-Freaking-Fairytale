(Dreaming of a Freaking Fairy Tale)

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,359
It's a dangerous place outside of the bed.

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:10,759
I won't leave.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,759
Do you truly think...

5
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:18,320
the bed is a safe area?

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,719
There you go!

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,839
Have you, a person in their own world,

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,160
met someone who drags you out...

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,079
by the collar?

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,479
When you do, you'll end up cussing right away.

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,890
But the outside world is nice.

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,479
There is more delicious food outside.

(Episode 8: A Very Old Reconciliation)

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,159
Don't go to Baek Ddong.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,880
What is wrong with you?

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,359
You shouldn't go to a guy's place late at night.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,880
Isn't this also a guy's place?

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,679
Is that why you're still hanging on to the bathrobe belt?

19
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,399
Right.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
No.

21
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,239
It's nothing like that.

22
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,840
What is up with him?

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,280
Just stay like this.

24
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:20,439
Stay here.

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,840
I'm not a dangerous guy.

26
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,519
But he's a mystery.

27
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,079
To me, you're the most mysterious guy.

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,879
What do you want to know about me?

29
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,959
Everything.

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,760
Everything about you makes me curious.

31
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,599
But I must go home now.

32
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,840
Oh, home?

33
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,200
Why? Did you reconcile?

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,560
She wants Hanwoo together.

35
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,280
She's requesting a sincere reconciliation, so I must go.

36
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,079
Then we should sleep next time.

37
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,239
Sorry?

38
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,530
What do you mean by sleep?

39
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,240
Didn't you want to swap places for the night?

40
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,810
Oh, right.

41
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:24,240
So you were sincere about swapping places for the night.

42
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,090
I wanted to prove to you.

43
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,240
Prove that it wasn't a lie.

44
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,560
You won't get any meat.

45
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,439
(Kang Hwa Jin)

46
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,360
Why won't my feet move?

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,759
It hasn't even been midnight.

48
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,360
But this Cinderella leaves for meat.

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,319
Had he stopped me a bit more, I would've returned.

50
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,919
I'm simply no better than an innkeeper worm or meat.

51
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,599
What's wrong with me?

52
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,080
How annoying.

53
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,039
- Here. - Yes.

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,960
- Here I go. - Wait.

55
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,520
Welcome, Jae Rim.

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,840
- Welcome. - Welcome.

57
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,439
Let's go.

58
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,280
- Let's go! - Let's go.

59
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,479
Jae Rim.

60
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,479
I made your sisters drunk first.

61
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,759
You know Hwa Jin becomes gentle when she gets drunk.

62
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,120
Oh, right.

63
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,840
Listen.

64
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,240
I got this back.

65
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,680
(Mount Sapae)

66
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,520
Doesn't he look like Cha Eun Woo?

67
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,199
He's too handsome.

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,400
We should've met sooner.

69
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,960
If you had met Dad sooner, he would've given you a harder time.

70
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,879
Jae Rim. Today, I want to talk about you,

71
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,520
not your dad.

72
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,680
Do you truly not think of us as your family?

73
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,639
I simply thought...

74
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,170
we could never become a real family.

75
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,680
That was why I acted indifferently and meanly on purpose.

76
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,439
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,560
You can be mean at times.

78
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,519
We'll still be a family, you know?

79
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,170
Hey, Shin Jae Rim.

80
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,399
These monsters.

81
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,759
They're already sober.

82
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,610
Drink more. Come on, guys.

83
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,279
All right.

84
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,319
Don't drink, Jae Rim.

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,639
What did you put inside it, Mom?

86
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,000
It's good.

87
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,170
Soo Jin. I'm sorry.

88
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,959
I had no idea he was a scumbag.

89
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,000
It's okay.

90
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,360
It's my fault in the end.

91
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,800
I was the one who dated him.

92
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,879
You did nothing wrong.

93
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,879
Date all kinds of guys.

94
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,959
Marrying the right guy is what's important.

95
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,639
Stop going on about marriage.

96
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,199
I'm happy, okay? Stop nagging already.

97
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,610
Do you hate living with us now that we're adults?

98
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,920
That's not it.

99
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,639
I'm worried you'll get stressed out when I depend on you...

100
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,600
when time gets hard.

101
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,720
You can depend on me when it gets tough.

102
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,720
I grew up to be a fine person,

103
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,720
all to become a helpful person to you, Mom.

104
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,319
Think more highly of me.

105
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,319
You're right.

106
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,879
My eldest has grown up to be a fine girl.

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,839
Same here.

108
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,160
You can depend on me.

109
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,279
I'll be at your beck and call.

110
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
"Beck and call?"

111
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,959
- Come here. I'll be at yours. - What is it?

112
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,519
- Your beck and call! - Look at them getting along well.

113
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,920
- I'm your beck and call. - Let go. It's hot.

114
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,639
"It snowed as if..."

115
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,959
"love was falling..."

116
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,959
"from the memory hole?"

117
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,639
What does this even mean?

118
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,160
How am I supposed to draw this?

119
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,079
Goodness.

120
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,639
I've removed the lens for you.

121
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,959
You're a lovely child too.

122
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
Good grief.

123
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,199
He's a nobleman, isn't he?

124
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,360
Flirting with me like that was foul play.

125
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,959
Come to your senses, Shin Jae Rim.

126
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,519
Don't get bewitched by him.

127
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,879
Even the smallest move can cause a spark.

128
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,480
You must be careful at all times.

129
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,000
"From the memory hole."

130
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,079

(Sungjin University Hospital)

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,360
Good gracious.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,519
Why did you admit yourself into the hospital again?

134
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,279
The doctor told me your results were fine.

135
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,600
Isn't it obvious? I am terribly sick.

136
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,439
The results being fine is the problem.

137
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,040
I can't eat a thing. My mouth feels too dry.

138
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,480
I can't even drink water, you know?

139
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,759
That's why I can't have instant food like this one.

140
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:10,160
Really, that gluttony of yours.

141
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,360
You're really digging in.

142
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,839
You're faking your illness to get attention, right?

143
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,920
Mind your manners to your father, will you?

144
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,279
Don't speak to me like that.

145
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,399
If you're bored, shall I introduce you to a lady I know?

146
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:25,079
She's almost 60 and has all her teeth. She's not bad.

147
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,160
She's healthy and must've lived a long life, so no.

148
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,879
I told you men like us must consider women like mere rocks.

149
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,800
They're not rocks, so stop saying that.

150
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,210
Shouldn't we also enjoy what others do?

151
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,210
Didn't your very own mother cause this scar?

152
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,090
That wicked woman.

153
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,120
Dad.

154
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,679
You shouldn't say that in front of your son.

155
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,879
I'm saying it because you are before me, okay?

156
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,679
Are you taking your mom's side?

157
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,519
Please, stop.

158
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,399
- Can't you forget about her now? - I can't.

159
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
If you behave like this because you like someone,

160
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,210
I'm cutting ties with you.

161
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,159
That woman is pretending to like and love you.

162
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,879
But she's only using you.

163
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,720
That might not be true.

164
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,240
Must she hurt you to come to your senses?

165
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,360
Disobey me, and I'll kick you out with only your underwear on.

(VIP Room)

167
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,039
Your mom is having an affair.

168

She's leaving with that man.

00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,000
No. That can't be true.

170
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,399
Mom! Don't go!

171
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,120
Mom!

172
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Don't go, Mom!

173
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,759
Please don't go, Mom!

174
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,480
Never will I be able to forget that.

175
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,090
Welcome.

176
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,919
Jae Rim.

177
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,519
She is the one who introduced me to Chungdam Heaven.

178
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,450
But she's never been here.

179
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,799
So I brought her with my invitation.

180
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,330
I see.

181
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,210
Nice to meet you.

182
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,519
She's the matriarch of Korea's movie industry.

183
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,210
Hi. My name is Lily Cho.

184
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,840
Allow me to lead the way.

185
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,919
Let's go.

186
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,240
Why would you set up the Christmas tree this early?

187
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,720
It's always been like this...

188
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:37,600
to maintain the Christmas vibe as long as possible.

189
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,679
Chungdam Heaven must really love Christmas.

190
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,759
That is the very reason we hold a lighting ceremony...

191
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,639
and have a resort solely for the lighting ceremony.

192
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,639
I can't wait to see it.

193
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,559
We have to light it up when Mr. Moon gets here.

194
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,679
Or he sulks.

195
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,120
Who are you saying will sulk?

196
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,360
Get it ready.

197
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,360
Now then, I will turn the tree lights on.

198
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,720
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

199
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,000
How pretty.

200
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,639
It's gorgeous.

201
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,279
- What does it say? - Hey.

202
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,759
"You are super popular but will marry soon."

203
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
This was mine.

204
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,120
Why did you have to pick this one?

205
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,759
That could be fate.

206
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,960
Dan A is his fiancee. They could soon get married.

207
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,399
Aren't I right, Dan A?

208
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,799
That was totally mine!

209
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,399
Shin Jae Rim.

210
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:39,320
She irritates me in every single way.

211
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,840
When do I teach her a lesson?

212
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,240
Is she still working here?

213
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,200
Why haven't you fired her?

214
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,919
I can't do anything, can I?

215
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,399
She even ignored my warning last time.

216
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,399
Girls like her scare me.

217
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,399
You told her nicely, didn't you?

218
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,799
Why are you so soft-hearted?

219
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,240
Over here!

220
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,600
Please excuse me.

221
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,279
- Yes? - How shameless of you...

222
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,559
to still work here.

223
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,639
Of course.

224
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,519
After all, I didn't do anything wrong.

225
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,080
Wipe it, will you?

226
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,639
Stop it, Ri Na.

227
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,480
There are thoughtless girls like her...

228
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,799
because you're kind to anyone.

229
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,360
Please wait a moment.

230
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,919
Someone like her should be trampled over like this.

231
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:50,039
Even so, she's my worker.

232
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,799
How frustrating.

233
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:06,159
Your eyes fixed on the ground suits you perfectly.

234
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
Baek Do Hong and Moon Cha Min.

235
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,320
Both are way out of your league.

236
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,639
Quit dreaming about the impossible.

237
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,039
Hold back.

238
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,960
Hold back.

239
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,480
Hold back, Darn Cha Min.

240
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,840
You're being too harsh when she's diligently wiping the floor.

241
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,039
She's nothing but someone who cleans up my mess.

242
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,759
In short, a servant.

243
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,639
Don't hold back.

244
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,120
You matter too.

245
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,759
He's right. What's the point of living like this?

246
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,440
I don't care now.

247
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,559
It seems you're dying to fight with me.

248
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,519
In a real fight,

249
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:59,559
you should be determined to risk your life and go all out.

250
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,360
Die like this,

251
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,679
and whose life do you think will be a waste? Yours or mine?

252
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Shall we die and find out...

253
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,639
who will randomly be born rich in our next lives?

254
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,799
No, thank you.

255
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,039
Whether I dream of the impossible or not...

256
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,919
is mine to decide!

257
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,440
Director.

258
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,960
This worker must be crazy.

259
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,720
If a customer is crazy, so must the worker be.

260
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,559
You never had to read the air,

261
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,840
so you have no idea how loud you are. Do you?

262
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,240
Jae Rim isn't the one hitting on me.

263
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,480
It's me who has feelings for her.

264
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,200
Goodness. Jae Rim is lucky.

265
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,120
Director Baek Do Hong openly confessed to her.

266
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,879
Will she become Cinderella?

267
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,559
She's here.

268
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,879
Hey, Jae Rim.

269
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,399
Are you quitting now?

270
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,360
What are you saying?

271
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,320
I'm scared I might get fired, okay?

272
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,200
How come? You have Director Baek to go to, no?

273
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,919
It seemed like he was head over heels in love with you.

274
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,320
Hey. Jae Rim is also in love with Director Baek.

275
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,720
Mr. Moon. Do we need to hire a new worker?

276
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,399
What is wrong with you?

277
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,879
Can't you see what a hard worker I am?

278
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,000
Let's get to work, okay?

279
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,799
You haven't wiped the glasses.

280
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,639
Nor have you cleaned the place well.

281
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,799
Mr. Moon.

282
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:17,000
My apologies for making a scene before the customers.

283
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Forget about it.

284
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,119
Mr. Moon.

285
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,200
To be honest, I don't like Baek Do Hong.

286
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,839
You're the one I like, you idiot.

287
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:34,039
That woman is pretending to like and love you.

288
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,759
But she's only using you.

289
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,240
What does that make Baek Do Hong?

290
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,240
He was serious to the point of confessing to you before others.

291
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,799
Did you use him?

292
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,519
Sorry?

293
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,599
If you have a sense of conscience, act with sincerity.

294
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:50,559
Are you implying I have no sense of conscience or sincerity?

295
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:53,960
I wouldn't know, would I? You should know yourself.

296
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,839
I was the idiot.

297
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,410
What's wrong with me?

298
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,170
Is it Dad's curse?

299
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,440
Are you okay?

300
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,890
About what?

301
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,410
I declared my feelings for Jae Rim.

302
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:38,839
"Declared?"

303
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,200
But what can you do?

304
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,720
You have a fiancee to marry soon.

305
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,000
Shouldn't you back off now?

306
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,410
I'll take great care of the girl...

307
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,410
you played the fool with.

308
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,079
You should take care of yourself now.

309
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,599
Come at me.

310
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,799
- Come here. - You little...

311
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,319
- Come here! - I did martial arts!

312
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,319
Really.

313
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,759
- You little... - Gosh.

314
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,559
Come here!

315
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:17,890
Record all of this.

316
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,890
Come over here!

317
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:23,200
- Let go. Do it now. - I will after you do it first.

318
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,759
- How old are you? - That's my line.

319
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,799
- Show me your ID card. - Show me yours.

320
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,799
- Do it. - You do it.

321
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,039
- Let go. - No, you let go.

322
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,519
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

323
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:39,000
- I knew it, you punk! Let go! - Let go of me!

324
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,279
You little...

325
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:42,759
Seriously.

326
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,170
Darn it.

327
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,599
Shin Jae Rim!

328
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,279
- Lily? - Oh, no.

329
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,480
I got the wrong person.

330
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,240
I only wanted you two to stop.

331
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,759
I simply hit the other head to be fair.

332
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,480
You really...

333
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:06,410
Like I wouldn't know.

334
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,920
You've simply lost it again and are making me confused.

335
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,559
Only I can bring you back to your senses.

336
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,960
What if I lost all of my hair?

337
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,890
Jae Rim. Why did you not take my side?

338
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,170
Why did I have to?

339
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,599
"Why?"

340
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,599
Aren't I your CEO?

341
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,039
Your salary is from me!

342
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,799
I see. So, a CEO can act selfishly.

343
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:30,920
"Act selfishly?"

344
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:33,039
I have always lived like this.

345
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,720
You can act selfishly with me,

346
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,559
but not with Baek Do Hong.

347
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,920
Are you taking his side even now?

348
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,359
Didn't you tell me to treat Baek Do Hong with sincerity?

349
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,119
Didn't you tell me you didn't like him?

350
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,650
So what do you want me to do?

351
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,599
Take my side even if I act selfishly!

352
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,759
No way!

353
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,319
Even if you're the CEO, you shouldn't live as you fit.

354
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,759
Being with you makes me confused. It drives me crazy.

355
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:59,650
And me? Do you think I don't get confused when I'm with you?

356
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,890
Is that so?

357
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,319
Then, my apologies.

358
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,039
For a mere worker to make the CEO confused every day.

359
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,519
"A mere worker?" Did you really have to put it like that?

360
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,759
Are you going to keep that up?

361
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,799
Yes, I will!

362
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,599
I really have no idea what to do whenever I'm with you!

363
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,480
- Seriously! - Where are you going?

364
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,240
I'm not done talking yet. Come back here. Come back!

365
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,319
I'm not done talking yet!

366
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,359
It hurts.

367
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:27,039
(Chungdam Heaven)

368
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,650
Do Hong.

369
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,599
We came back to see you, Jae Rim.

370
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,759
I wanted to apologize for the commotion earlier.

371
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,200
Is your head okay, Do Hong?

372
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,960
Today was a very eventful day, right?

373
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,319
Let's end the day with some drinks at my studio.

374
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,559
Okay.

375
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,559
You're not the only confused one.

376
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:10,960
I'm also confused, you know?

377
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,519
Here, listen.

378
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,759
One breaks down if you step on the accelerator...

379
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,480
and the brake at the same time.

380
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:25,119
My wish to get closer to her is getting bigger and bigger.

381
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,920
But I can't do it.

382
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,480
So,

383
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,200
it's driving me nuts.

384
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,079
Come on, say something.

385
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,480
Is keeping your mouth open all you can do?

386
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,960
This darn Chivas Regal.

387
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:00,960
What's your relationship with Mr. Moon Cha Min?

388
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:08,160
Actually, I heard you two fight in his office.

389
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,839
Who knows?

390
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,680
Even I don't know what we are.

391
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,160
He's such a mysterious guy.

392
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,119
But Mr. Moon...

393
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,359
He doesn't have everything.

394
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,119
Because he was raised without a mom, he's quite...

395
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:31,119
emotionally unstable.

396
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,599
Still, love him. Stay by his side and shower him with love.

397
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,599
How did you know about that?

398
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,440
To be frank with you,

399
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,799
I'm Cha Min's mom.

400
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,240
Although I left when he was young.

401
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,440
I was that so-called Cinderella.

402
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:01,880
"All that penniless woman knew was how to seduce men."

403
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,279
"And now look at her soft life."

404
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,039
I was looked down upon before my young son.

405
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,279
Just thinking about the day...

406
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,400
Cha Min would grow up to understand those words...

407
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,119
It made me feel miserable. So, I couldn't live like that.

408
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,680
I...

409
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,079
Because I wanted to become an honorable mom like the others,

410
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,960
I started to work.

411
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:26,559
But my mother-in-law, who was unhappy with me, took the chance...

412
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,480
and accused me as an adulteress.

413
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,279
How could she do that?

414
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,640
Cha Min's dad was abroad most of the time...

415
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,079
because of the overseas resort business.

416
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,759
He didn't believe a word I said.

417
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,160
As I was incompetent when we got divorced,

418
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:48,400
I couldn't even protect my son and got kicked out.

419
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,680
But you returned as a competent businesswoman.

420
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:00,559
It all happened because I had no power.

421
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,480
I was determined to come back as a successful woman...

422
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,079
so no one could get in the way of me...

423
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,359
getting my son back.

424
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,359
But I was too late.

425
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,680
It's too late.

426
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,480
Now,

427
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,599
Cha Min scares me the most.

428
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,319
He must resent those past days.

429
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,720
But I am too shameless to ask for forgiveness.

430
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,519
That is why I'm living such a cowardly life.

431
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,640
Are you fine with just looking at him from afar?

432
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,480
Why don't you talk to him?

433
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,400
Mr. Moon is quite warm-hearted.

434
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,319
I have no courage.

435
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
I'm starting to understand that wacko.

436
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,880
He turned out like that because he didn't receive any affection.

437
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,880
But what do I tell him?

438
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,240
He's always full of doubts.

439
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,799
One mistake, and I'll get hit in the stomach with Chairman Ko.

440
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,240
All right. Let's wake right up after I black out for a bit.

441
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:41,920
Shin Jae Rim.

442
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,720
I like you loads.

443
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,720
That was why I did it.

444
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:57,759
I'm sorry...

445
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,680
for being a wacko.

446
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,759
What a wacko.

447
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
I'm sorry.

448
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:25,799
Welcome, Mr. Moon.

449
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,559
What's this? What's wrong with you?

450
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,680
It's me, Shin Jae Rim, always on your side...

451
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,160
starting today.

452
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,720
Do you need your salary in advance?

453
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:36,960
That's not it.

454
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,960
You scared me.

455
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,319
- What is up with you? - Mr. Moon.

456
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,519
You used the bar yesterday, didn't you?

457
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,119
I did. I had some drinks alone.

458
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,279
Why did you do that?

459
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:54,880
How could you drink Ms. Kim Eun Ji's Chivas Regal we kept for her?

460
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,960
Watch your mouth.

461
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,359
We can simply order more of it.

462
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,279
Hey, listen.

463
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,359
Mr. Moon could lack common sense.

464
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,519
Let's be understanding even if he's a bit of a fool.

465
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,359
Right?

466
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,079
Cheer up.

467
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:14,359
Hey.

468
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,480
Remember the tteokbokki we had last time?

469
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,920
Can I have some of that again?

470
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,319
No. I'm busy.

471
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,440
Come on.

472
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,480
Mr. Moon is in his growing period.

473
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,960
He could grow taller.

474
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,079
That's all the more the reason I won't make it.

475
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,160
Are you hungry, Mr. Moon?

476
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,519
Should I make it instead?

477
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:39,079
Let's eat the tteokbokki you're craving, okay?

478
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,880
I'm fine. I don't want any.

479
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,079
Tell me when you want some.

480
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,200
Does that never break?

481
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,480
How much longer will you carry it around?

482
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,359
What? Does it bother you?

483
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,880
You look like the biggest wacko.

484
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,359
Who are you saying is a wacko?

485
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,559
Get to know him better, and you'll find out he's normal.

486
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Which part of him do you mean?

487
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:01,240
He's got two eyes, two nostrils,

488
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,279
and two ears.

489
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,400
Show me your teeth.

490
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,319
Seriously.

491
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,960
He's even got two front teeth. Very normal, right?

492
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,200
- You. - Yes?

493
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,799
- Are you insulting me right now? - No.

494
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:13,079
Come with me.

495
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,240
Understood.

496
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,880
Is it that difficult to take my side?

497
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,240
Is this you protesting?

498
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,559
No. I'm being serious.

499
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,799
You little...

500
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,519
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

501
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,319
Actually,

502
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,279
I'm seeing you in a new light.

503
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,079
In what way?

504
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,680
If you want to know,

505
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,200
why don't we have a meal today?

506
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,960
It'll be on me.

507
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,960
- You'll treat me to a meal? - That's right.

508
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:46,079
You've never been treated to a meal, have you? It's delicious.

509
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,279
I haven't. No.

510
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,240
Then we're grabbing a meal together today, okay?

511
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,039
Okay.

512
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,400
(Sungjin University Hospital)

513
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,680
What? Gu Nam Hoon asked you that favor, too?

514
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,599
I couldn't refuse, okay?

515
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,880
I even did it twice.

516
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,799
Good grief, what an idiot.

517
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,400
What kind of a guy practices proposing to a girl?

518
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,440
By the way, who do you think the actual girl is?

519
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,119
I don't know, but I feel bad for her.

520
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,240
Let's go. Come on.

521
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,799
So he wasn't proposing to someone else,

522
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,880
but practicing?

523
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,160
(1 Unread Message)

524
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,960
Can we meet at the rooftop for a minute?

525
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,240
(Marry Me)

526
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,319
Soo Jin. Despite everything...

527
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:54,200
- What? - Despite everything, marry me.

528
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,000
Did my sister not beat you up enough?

529
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,480
Or did you lose it from all the beating up?

530
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:03,240
I'm prepared to get one of my guts busted.

531
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,400
Why must you go all out on everything?

532
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,799
You know I'm the kind of man to go all out.

533
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,519
As the eldest of a Korean family,

534
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:17,160
I hate taking responsibility and sticking to customs.

535
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:19,640
Rather than a burdensome marriage,

536
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,720
I want to live at ease with someone.

537
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,480
If that someone can be me,

538
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,839
you can use me all you want.

539
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,440
Shouldn't a proposal have some music?

540
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:37,880
"Music..."

541
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:46,839
Hey

542
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,559
Okay

543
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,319
Kang Soo Jin, the name of the one I love

544
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:53,599
My confession right now is an aggressive move

545
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,960
We met at the OB-GYN

546
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,359
And I want to live with my life companion

547
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:00,720
I'm extremely embarrassed right now

548
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,599
If you hate what you're seeing, run away

549
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:05,279
Despite it, will you accept my confession?

550
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,759
I'll go back if you reject me

551
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,599
You're Dr. Gu

552
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,960
Your confession isn't that good

553
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:20,200
You're a horse running straight towards me

554
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,599
Gallop

555
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,839
Gallop

556
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,880
Gallop

557
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,440
Your constant effort

558
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,960
Has won me over

559
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,599
(Marry Me)

560
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,400
What's with this nice restaurant out of the blue?

561
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:08,359
I need to bring something up, but carefully at that.

562
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,920
Since when were you careful?

563
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:11,839
What is it?

564
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,720
Know that I'm mustering up my courage, okay?

565
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:16,799
And for your sake.

566
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,519
I don't want you to live with a misunderstanding of the world.

567
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,960
I'll take out that thorn in your eyes today.

568
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,759
Even if it hurts, don't move.

569
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,200
What are you up to?

570
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
Where are you going?

571
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,920
The two of you must have lots to talk about.

572
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,240
I'll be waiting outside.

573
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,719
Why did you want to see me?

574
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,639
Before that, who are you?

575
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,199
Cha Min.

576
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,400
I'm sorry.

577
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,199
I'm...

578
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,719
I'm your mom.

579
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
"Mom?"

580
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:38,289
Too shameless,

581
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:40,199
I couldn't disclose myself as your mom.

582
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,559
I wanted to hide it.

583
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,960
But I am your mom.

584
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
Mom!

585
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,119
Don't go!

586
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:04,880
Mom!

587
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,769
- Cha Min... - Don't go, Mom!

588
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:09,960
- Please stop the car. - Mom!

589
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:12,960
- Cha Min fell down. - Mom!

590
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,360
You can't meet your son at any cost. That's the rule.

591
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,199
I'm sorry.

592
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:29,719
Please don't go, Mom!

593
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,360
Cha Min.

594
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:37,920
- Cha Min. - Mom!

595
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,769
What a sweetheart.

596
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:43,329
- My son. - Mom.

597
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:46,519
I'm over the moon when you smile.

598
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:55,880
I don't need a mom. You can leave.

599
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,239
I thought only I could undo what I made you go through.

600
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:00,440
After all this time?

601
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,329
I heard you couldn't go around without that umbrella.

602
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,519
- It's none of your business. - No, it is.

603
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,769
After all, I'm the reason behind it.

604
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,599
I missed you so much,

605
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,119
so I asked your aunt.

606
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:20,000
But little did I know Mother-in-law would come all the way there.

607
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,400
Though it failed in the end,

608
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,329
I never thought you would get hurt, too.

609
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,079
I didn't have an affair.

610
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,079
Nor were you kidnapped, Cha Min.

611
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,679
Your incompetent mom...

612
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:40,480
only hurt you out of love for you.

613
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:44,840
I'm sorry.

614
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,960
Stop lying.

615
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,960
I can forget about that affair and kidnapping.

616
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,440
You said you loved me.

617
00:36:58,289 --> 00:36:59,920
Then you wouldn't have made me live...

618
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,559
with a misunderstanding for that long.

619
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:02,639
Dad and I...

620
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,639
Do you know how much pain we were in?

621
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,559
You came after all this time because you missed me. But what?

622
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,719
It was out of love?

623
00:37:17,329 --> 00:37:18,559
Stop kidding me.

624
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,360
In the end,

625
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:26,039
you're a selfish person prioritizing yourself over me and Dad.

626
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,809
So what love?

627
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,769
Just be honest.

628
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:36,079
Are you out of alimony?

629
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,289
No.

630
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,079
Believe me.

631
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:42,159
I came to apologize sincerely.

632
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:44,960
Please, believe me, Cha Min.

633
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,559
Stop with the excuses.

634
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,920
It's really disgusting.

635
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,039
Cha Min...

636
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,920
Mom...

637
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,480
Where did you go?

638
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:27,639
Are you okay?

639
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:32,809
You've crossed the line.

640
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:34,880
Who do you think you are?

641
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,719
Why did I have to listen to her lies because of you?

642
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,519
"Lies?"

643
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:39,599
You call her a mom?

644
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:41,480
A person like her isn't one.

645
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:44,329
She did it out of love despite not loving me?

646
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,289
You call that love?

647
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,840
She just came to get something out of me.

648
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:50,360
It's not like that.

649
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,039
Then what is it? Why did she come now after leaving me years ago?

650
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,960
I don't understand.

651
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,559
Nobody would trouble...

652
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,239
or make the person you love suffer their entire life.

653
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,079
Everyone has their own circumstances.

654
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,809
I know it's hard to understand.

655
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:11,480
But don't doubt her love for you.

656
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,440
It's only hurting you.

657
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:17,960
Love doesn't exist.

658
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,599
Do you really think so?

659
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,329
Even if I want to believe it exists,

660
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:24,000
there's no way to know if it does.

661
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:49,239
Don't say anything. Just feel it.

662
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,440
Love can't be put to words. Nor can it be understood with our heads.

663
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,920
But it's definitely in our hearts.

664
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,880
How can she not love you?

665
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,400
Mom!

666
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:35,440
She has always loved you.

667
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:09,599
Just like how Earth keeps spinning around despite us...

668
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,119
not feeling it,

669
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,480
even though we can't see love,

670
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,079
love is always within us.
