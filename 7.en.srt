(Poison)

3
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:16,039
Men who confuse me. I hate them.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,679
Get out of my life!

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,359
I love you!

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,320
What?

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,600
Not expressing your feelings in advance...

8
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,359
could lead to misunderstanding or even murder,

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,719
so it's important that you get into the habit of saying things like...

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,439
"Thank you" and "I love you."

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,399
Or they'll never know.

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,530
(Episode 7: If You Don't Say It, They'll Never Know)

13
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,719
I was worried sick.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,880
Mr. Moon.

15
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,960
Are you all right?

16
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,880
Just untie me.

17
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,879
Oh, right. Okay.

18
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,769
Don't cut the rope. Untie it and give it to me.

19
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:12,959
What?

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,319
My goodness. What was the thing I felt just now?

21
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,319
- It wasn't mine. Gosh! - What the...

22
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,640
This is making me so uncomfortable.

23
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,560
Come on, Dae Bong. This is uncomfortable for me too.

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,359
Jae Rim, do you have to tie them up like this?

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,560
Shouldn't you tie them up with their backs facing each other?

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,840
Whatever, it's fine. It's already done.

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,079
I can't believe this.

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,079
Hey, nephew-in-law.

29
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:38,959
"Nephew-in-law?"

30
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,200
The truth is, we're Dan A's step-uncles.

31
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,280
You see, this is a family matter.

32
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,519
Let's resolve it amongst ourselves instead of calling the police.

33
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:49,959
We just couldn't see Dan A cry. That's all.

34
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:52,719
Or, you couldn't put up with her lashing out at you.

35
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,319
So, why did you cheat on her with that ugly woman?

36
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,319
Hey, seriously!

37
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,480
Am I ugly?

38
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,560
Then did you cheat on her with me?

39
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,040
- No. - Hey, we're sorry.

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,370
We just wanted to scare this woman a little.

41
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,039
We'll have big problems if the families find out.

42
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,479
It won't do you any good either, Moon.

43
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,879
You see, I don't want to get the police involved either,

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,090
but people like you guys need a serious lesson.

45
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,240
- What? - But the law is too lenient.

46
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,879
What's she saying?

47
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,090
I'll get my own revenge.

48
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,759
What?

49
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Oh, no.

50
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,090
You guys called me ugly.

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,680
Hey, look here.

52
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:58,400
Goodness. What have you done to our eyebrows?

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,199
Hey, I took pictures of your faces.

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,759
If anything bad happens to me, I'll know you're the culprit.

55
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
- Okay. - Yes, ma'am.

56
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,400
You'd better not do this again.

57
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,560
You must've been really scared.

58
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,840
You're safe now. You can relax.

59
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,639
Why is hearing that bringing tears to my eyes?

60
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:28,680
Because it's natural to get teary-eyed when you relax...

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,159
and let your guard down in front of someone who makes you feel safe.

62
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,039
Dan A's family is like that,

63
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,879
but don't mind them.

64
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,159
I'll make sure they don't bother you again.

65
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,159
What is it? What's wrong?

66
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,240
This is all your fault!

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,919
What is this?

68
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,960
All right.

69
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,719
You know, I'd let you hit me,

70
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,960
but that really hurt.

71
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,960
Show me your fist. You must be holding something.

72
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
There's nothing.

73
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,319
Whatever. I'm telling you. This is all your fault!

74
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,759
Seriously.

75
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,730
I was so scared.

76
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,800
Once again, I'm really sorry.

77
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,639
For what? What are you apologizing for?

78
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,759
For meddling in your business when I promised I wouldn't...

79
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,399
and for how all of this happened because of me.

80
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,240
For all of it.

81
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,170
No.

82
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,959
It was because of me.

83
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,439
This is what every femme fatale experiences.

84
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,120
I know you can't get me out of your mind no matter how hard you try...

85
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,800
because I'm irresistibly charming.

86
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,480
Stop cracking jokes with me.

87
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,519
Anyway, are you really okay?

88
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,399
Weren't you shocked?

89
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,759
I sure was.

90
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,170
How did you find me and show up so quickly?

91
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,800
I'm always prepared for a kidnapping incident.

92
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,680
With my umbrella, Chairman Ko.

93
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,170
Why? Were you kidnapped in the past?

94
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,680
Yes.

95
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,480
My nanny, whom I trusted and was fond of,

96
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,399
schemed with others and kidnapped me.

97
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,610
Every important woman in my life has betrayed me.

98
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,079
But I managed to escape right away, using that umbrella...

99
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,600
as my weapon and shield.

100
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,240
My gosh! No wonder.

101
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,560
I admit that this crazy-looking umbrella was quite useful today.

102
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,160
Yes.

103
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,879
You need something like this,

104
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,519
living in this world where you can trust no one.

105
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,079
Do you want one?

106
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,319
No, I'm good.

107
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,399
What saved me was neither this umbrella nor my pepper spray.

108
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,720
It was you.

109
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,439
Go on.

110
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,199
Okay, bye.

111
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,879
Hey, Shin Jae Rim.

112
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,959
Get home safely.

113
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,360
I will.

114
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,120
Why are my feelings getting stronger for Jae Rim?

115
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,959
I want to trust her and confess my feelings to her.

116
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,839
(Radio)

117
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,639
If you like someone but can't tell the person you like them,

118
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,079
then you're a coward.

119
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,959
(Coward)

120
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,879
I was worried sick.

121
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,639
It seems that he truly cares about me.

122
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,399
No. The way he was looking at me tells me that he likes me.

123
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
So why...

124
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,240
Don't tell me...

125
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,600
he simply can't accept me because I'm way below his league.

126
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,040
To him, I guess I'm...

127
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,560
just an unwelcome guest who amuses him.

128
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,600
I wish to meet someone who'd welcome me.

129
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,800
I'm home.

130
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,519
Shin Jae Rim, we heard Gu Nam Hoon gave you money.

131
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,319
You got money from him and told him what Soo Jin liked...

132
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,120
so he could make a move on her.

133
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:36,120
I can't believe you sold Soo Jin off to such a liar.

134
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,330
Why? What happened?

135
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,519
I caught him...

136
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,679
hitting on another girl.

137
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,960
He just wanted to date one of the doctors...

138
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,159
and get married soon.

139
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,279
I was too naive.

140
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,679
Soo Jin.

141
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,600
Because of you, we all thought he really liked her.

142
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,720
I thought he was being sincere too.

143
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,450
Also, he's a doctor, and he seemed nice.

144
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,279
So? That's why you decided to sell her off to him?

145
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,330
How could you say that?

146
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,639
You do anything and everything for personal gain.

147
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,159
Is that really what you think of me?

148
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:28,240
Yes. You're a selfish brat who only cares about herself.

149
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,360
That's enough, you two.

150
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:32,210
It is all my fault, so stop fighting.

151
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,840
Mom, how could you take Jae Rim's side?

152
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,090
If she'd really thought of us as her family,

153
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,919
she would've never even thought to accept that jerk into the family.

154
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,210
You tell me first. Have you ever thought of me as your family?

155
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,919
Never, right? Because I'm not your real family.

156
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:51,090
- Jae Rim. - How dare you? This is your fault.

157
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,960
Shall I really beat you up to a pulp?

158
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,759
You can't stand me, so you just want to give me a hard time.

159
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,399
You'll think whatever you want...

160
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,210
and keep accusing me no matter what I say.

161
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,240
You crazy brat. You need to apologize when you're at fault.

162
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,090
Fine, I apologize.

163
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,720
I'm really sorry.

164
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,279
I apologize for becoming a member of this family.

165
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,679
No. I'm sorry for being born.

166
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Shin Jae Rim.

167
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,399
We raised you wrong.

168
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,120
Yes, that's true too.

169
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,240
You brat. We kindly raised you, and you're lashing out at us.

170
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,919
If you're going to keep acting up like this, just move out!

171
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,960
Hey, that's enough.

172
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,330
Yes, I'm going to.

173
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,159
Thanks for that slap.

174
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,210
It gave me a wakeup call.

175
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,120
Hey, your so-called uncles kidnapped someone.

176
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,799
- What are you talking about? - Don't play dumb.

177
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,480
Didn't you tell them to kidnap Jae Rim?

178
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,399
That's right. I did.

179
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,960
You know that's how my family does things.

180
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,120
That's why I warned you not to upset me.

181
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,799
Mark my words. If you try to hurt Jae Rim again,

182
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,240
I will not go easy on you anymore.

183
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,679
What? Then what are you going to do?

184
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
I always put up with your temper, so you think I'm a pushover.

185
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,240
Cross the line once more,

186
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,919
and I'll end things with you.

187
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:38,120
I hate being an unwelcome guest too.

188
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,159
I'll just live alone. It's not like I grew up spoiled.

189
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,440
I'll take cold showers,

190
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,960
sleep on the floor, and live without a bidet.

191
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,679
I'll manage.

192
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,399
- You go in first. - No, after you.

193
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,639
Your eyebrows look like hairy caterpillars.

194
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,639
I asked you...

195
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,200
to go and pick up some bread for me.

196
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,759
But instead of picking up bread,

197
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,440
what on earth did you do?

198
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:26,080
I want my bread!

199
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,399
Yes, there you go.

200
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,919
It's not from Mont Chant Claire!

201
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,159
It's not what I asked for!

202
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,440
Only do what I tell you to do!

203
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,480
Why was I born here, of all places?

204
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,559
Why was I born like this?

205
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,559
Darn it.

206
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,240
I should just head out early.

207
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,600
Gosh, I can't take this anymore.

208
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,360
Why isn't this working?

209
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,120
Darn it.

210
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,320
Shin Jae Rim, you must stay strong.

211
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,840
I must go to work, no matter how lonely or sad I am.

212
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,639
(Moon Cha Min)

213
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,879
Today's morning meeting will be replaced...

214
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:54,159
by this special self-defense tutorial I prepared for you guys.

215
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,159
Applause, please.

216
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,080
But we never asked for it.

217
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,519
This is necessary though.

218
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,639
There have been many kidnapping incidents. It's a scary world.

219
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,039
Mr. Moon, the world has been a scary place since ancient times.

220
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,600
Anyway, how come Jae Rim is nowhere to be seen?

221
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,000
Well, Jae Rim said...

222
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
she'd be about 30 minutes late.

223
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,360
(Chungdam Heaven)

224
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,960
She's late even though she left early.

225
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,320
This shows the importance of where you stand on the starting line.

226
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,919
How will you work as an Angel Manager if you're this weak?

227
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,960
Get up right now.

228
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,799
I'm sorry I'm late.

229
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,440
Hey, why are you late?

230
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,799
I've moved to a faraway town.

231
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,639
What? I drove you home last night. You moved overnight?

232
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:52,720
Yes, it happens.

233
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,799
What happened last night?

234
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,039
He's unnecessarily sweet.

235
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,919
He's not mine, so I don't like this.

236
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,399
Whatever. Anyway, what are you wearing?

237
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,360
My gosh.

238
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,960
You look like an otaku who got dressed up for a blind date.

239
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,399
My goodness.

240
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,559
What? "Otaku?"

241
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,639
I'm wearing this for the special self-defense tutorial for the staff.

242
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,120
Are you doing this because of what happened yesterday?

243
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,720
This is not necessary.

244
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,759
You see, the world doesn't revolve around you.

245
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:27,240
I'm immensely interested in personal development.

246
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,600
I should do this with my employees. That's why I pay them.

247
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
So,

248
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,320
we can have a showdown if we do this, right?

249
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,480
We can have multiple showdowns.

250
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,159
You little...

251
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,360
This man...

252
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,440
keeps confusing me when he won't love me.

253
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,960
In the name of justice, I will not forgive you.

254
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Come at me.

255
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,440
You're a pervert,

256
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,879
- and I'm a woman. - What?

257
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,919
No, you should play a pervert.

258
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,480
I'm a black belt holder.

259
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,359
I should demonstrate.

260
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
I see.

261
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,960
Try hugging me like a pervert would.

262
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,559
Hey there, miss!

263
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,519
The palm-heel strike!

264
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,200
Are you all right? I'm sorry.

265
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,890
I thought I was going easy on you, but it knocked you down.

266
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,480
It's fine.

267
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,359
I think I've mastered it, so let's switch.

268
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,119
Okay, I like that glare.

269
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,039
Use this right away when you meet a bad man, okay?

270
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,599
You are bad.

271
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:52,079
I'll push you away too. I'll never fall for you.

272
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,410
All right!

273
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,170
The palm-heel strike!

274
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,480
Let's try that one more time.

275
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,039
Come here.

276
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,720
The palm-heel strike!

277
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,890
My turn.

278
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,799
The palm-heel strike!

279
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,839
This reminds me...

280
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,680
of how they keep wasting their time...

281
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,960
by pushing each other away.

282
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,799
Now, I'll show you how you can escape with your hands trapped.

283
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,599
To release the grip around your waist,

284
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:28,079
you should use your latissimus dorsi muscle, not your hand. Like this.

285
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,480
Master Choi Bae Dal used his latissimus dorsi muscle...

286
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,519
to pull out a bull's horns.

287
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:35,799
(Choi Bae Dal: The Master of Kyokushin Karate)

288
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,480
Where is the latissimus dorsi muscle?

289
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:38,559
Right there.

290
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,599
You certainly wouldn't want it there.

291
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,799
Lift your arm like this.

292
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,839
- Right there. - Here? It's a little...

293
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,240
Right here. You can touch it.

294
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
Here?

295
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,359
Oh, my.

296
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,359
What are you two doing?

297
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,650
What is this, a martial arts competition?

298
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,890
Only authorized personnel can enter, so get out.

299
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,519
I'm not here to see you.

300
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,890
I'm here to see Jae Rim.

301
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Hello.

302
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,559
We had fun at my studio. Didn't we, Jae Rim?

303
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,680
Pardon?

304
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,650
What's he saying? Did he have a dream or something?

305
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,170
Can we have a quick chat in private?

306
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,079
Sure.

307
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:37,519
All right, Master Choi Bae Dal.

308
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,359
Please excuse me.

309
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
All right.

310
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,279
Keep it up.

311
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,650
That little...

312
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,519
Gosh, that jerk.

313
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,079
What happened that day really made me want to work things out with you.

314
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,799
Did you get an electric shock?

315
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,240
You should date an elegant lady from a wealthy family.

316
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:04,960
Your secret is safe with me, so don't you worry.

317
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,200
No, it's not that. I'll never find anyone I like better...

318
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,410
than the woman who complimented my baby.

319
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:13,319
But your baby...

320
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,240
I'm sure you'll meet many women who like it.

321
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,480
But you're different, Jae Rim.

322
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,650
You're the first woman I've ever met who saw my everything...

323
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,279
and was still okay with it.

324
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,200
But you don't really know anything about me, Do Hong.

325
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,410
Why are you making a move on me when you hardly know me?

326
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,170
Because I'm confident about myself.

327
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,359
I'm confident that I can love you...

328
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,839
no matter what kind of person you are.

329
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:43,359
So just come to me.

330
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,599
("Come to Me")

331
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,039
And this. You left this at my studio the other day.

332
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,799
They had fun at his studio?

333
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,359
He couldn't wait to see her again, so he came here?

334
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,680
To do what?

335
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,240
What if someone sees us?

336
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,759
I don't care.

337
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,079
I can't hold back anymore.

338
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,599
Darn it!

339
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,799
It's already too late.

340
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,039
He's literally punching the ground because he regrets his decision.

341
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,960
I'm pretty sure...

342
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,359
Moon Cha Min has feelings for me, but he won't open up to me.

343
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,119
Meanwhile, Baek Do Hong is...

344
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,440
I'm not sure what he's really thinking,

345
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,799
but he told me to come to him, ready to welcome me with open arms.

346
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:50,359
(Follow Your Joy)

347
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,200
What should I do?

348
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:54,279
Hey.

349
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:57,000
Why did you actually hit me? Why?

350
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:00,559
You should've just pretended like you were doing it. Like this.

351
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:03,400
It's important to practice as if you're really doing it.

352
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,000
It hurts so much. Look.

353
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,400
I can't even move my neck.

354
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,319
If you keep hovering around me...

355
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:11,400
with toilet paper wrapped around your neck,

356
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,839
I'll hit you again on the same spot.

357
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,160
Seriously.

358
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,759
Look at you threatening me.

359
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:22,039
Hey, these moves.

360
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,839
Use them on Baek Do Hong, not me.

361
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,640
My gosh. Why should I?

362
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,240
My Do Hong is so adorable and precious.

363
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,759
What did you two do...

364
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,279
that you're already calling him precious?

365
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
Well...

366
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,640
Do Hong...

367
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:38,039
officially asked me out.

368
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,680
Do Hong asked me out in a straightforward manner...

369
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,839
because he's a real man.

370
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:46,519
"A real man?"

371
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,480
Hey, you have to be extra careful when dealing with men like him.

372
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,839
He may actually be a frivolous person.

373
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,599
What if he takes back his words later on?

374
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,480
That's true. You're right.

375
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,319
That's why I'm a little torn.

376
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,039
The truth is, Cinderella's father is a count,

377
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,319
but I'm no better than a butcher's daughter.

378
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,279
There's a huge gap between the ways we were brought up,

379
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,319
so it may not work out after all.

380
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,720
Goodness.

381
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,519
Get with the times.

382
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,480
Such a difference in upbringing shouldn't be a problem.

383
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,480
So, men can accept a woman who doesn't measure up to their tier?

384
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
You too?

385
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:29,160
Tier, my foot. Are you buying beef or something?

386
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,319
Shall I stamp you?

387
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,799
There's no such thing.

388
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:34,599
You're lying.

389
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,920
Just be honest with me.

390
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,079
It's hurtful to be comforted in a hypocritical manner.

391
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,759
White lies are bad too!

392
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,559
I'm not being hypocritical.

393
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:45,640
And if Baek Do Hong is like that, don't date him.

394
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
For you, I...

395
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,440
You, what?

396
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,640
I will...

397
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,160
Forget it.

398
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,240
Gosh, seriously.

399
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,039
How about you come over and sleep at my place?

400
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,039
What?

401
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
What?

402
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,400
Let me see if it's true or not.

403
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,480
Whether a change of environment would have an impact or not.

404
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,200
Are you in?

405
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,400
Hey, give me some time to think.

406
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,880
Hurry up and decide!

407
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,240
This drama...

408
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,759
is suddenly turning into "The Prince and the Pauper."

409
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,839
Hey, do I keep going straight?

410
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,640
Yes, keep going.

411
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,440
I must be losing my mind.

412
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,720
I can't believe I'm going home with a man.

413
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,480
Moon Cha Min, are you insane?

414
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,799
Why are you going to this woman's place?

415
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,960
What was I thinking?

416
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,079
I'm so reckless.

417
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,279
Hey, you could easily lose your grip. Stay frosty.

418
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
Ta-da!

419
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,920
This is my home.

420
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,440
It seems pretty bare, doesn't it?

421
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,799
What do you say? Do you think you can actually sleep here?

422
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:24,880
It looks like a forest where animals live.

423
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,440
A forest where animals live?

424
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,519
What? Who thinks this place looks like a forest?

425
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:32,559
My gosh.

426
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:35,319
You were this short when you were a kid.

427
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,559
I'd give you a noogie on the head if you were still this short.

428
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:40,519
Hey, can't you be serious for a moment?

429
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,519
I used to live here... No. I mean,

430
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:44,039
this is where I live now.

431
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,599
Doesn't it change your opinion of me?

432
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,519
Is it your fault that you were poor growing up?

433
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,640
No, right? So, who cares?

434
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,519
But I'm not so young anymore.

435
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,640
Right.

436
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,880
You're a bit too old for someone who wants to be Cinderella.

437
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,200
Hey, are you trying to throw marshmallows into the fire now?

438
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,799
Good idea.

439
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,839
I always carry my camping supplies in my car.

440
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:10,880
Let's have some food.

441
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:14,759
- Ta-da. - Oh, my.

442
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,759
This looks great.

443
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,880
My dad used to cook ramyeon for me just like this.

444
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,799
This is good. I haven't had it in a while.

445
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Really?

446
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,480
Where is your father now?

447
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,839
He passed away recently.

448
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:52,839
My dad and I used to live here together, just the two of us.

449
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,920
Then when he remarried,

450
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,359
we left this place and moved into a decent home.

451
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,880
Then why are you living here again?

452
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,519
Did they kick you out because he passed away?

453
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,759
My stepmom and stepsisters aren't mean.

454
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,920
But I'm a bad kid,

455
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,160
so I had a big fight with them and left.

456
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:16,400
Goodness. Why did you fight with them?

457
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,880
You should get along with them and stay there.

458
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,880
They aren't my real family, and we don't love each other,

459
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,000
so why should I stay with them?

460
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:24,960
Even I would find a girl like me annoying.

461
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,839
I'm incompetent and greedy.

462
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,279
No wonder they hate me.

463
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,160
I'm an annoying troublemaker.

464
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,160
You're looking at them through the lens of hatred.

465
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,200
Why are you calling yourself annoying?

466
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,079
All kids are greedy.

467
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,799
You can't hate them for that.

468
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,880
You've been hating yourself for a long time,

469
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,079
viewing the world through the lens of hatred.

470
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,759
I've removed the lens for you.

471
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,319
Now, take a good look at yourself.

472
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,880
You're a lovely child too.

473
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,519
That moment, I realized...

474
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,839
that all along,

475
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,000
I wanted to hear that I was a lovely child too.

476
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,200
- Mom! - Mom, we're home.

477
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,319
My princesses. My babies.

478
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:30,160
Why are you so adorable?

479
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:31,599
Come on in.

480
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,240
Jae Rim!

481
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,480
The moment I heard what I really wanted to hear...

482
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,400
after acting like I didn't need it for years,

483
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,680
I burst into tears as if I'd been waiting for this moment.

484
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Why are you crying?

485
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
Well...

486
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,200
I'm an adult now, but you keep calling me a child.

487
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,880
So I'm crying like a child. Like a little brat.

488
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,720
Then you can stay being a brat for the rest of your life.

489
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:06,599
Who cares?

490
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,680
It's not like you'll take care of me for the rest of my life.

491
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:13,160
So don't turn me into a brat.

492
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
Right, I can't take care of you forever.

493
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,400
I have to live my life too.

494
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,480
You're so mean.

495
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,680
That hurt.

496
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,000
Stop hitting me, will you?

497
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,319
You won't even look at me.

498
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,599
(Ban Dan A)

499
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,400
Shouldn't you answer that?

500
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,920
(Ban Dan A)

501
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,480
I don't want to be interrupted.

502
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,680
I haven't finished my food.

503
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,000
Once the lens of hatred was removed,

504
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,200
I started thinking that perhaps,

505
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:13,599
he couldn't accept me because of his own situation,

506
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,079
not because he thought I wasn't good enough for him.

507
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,519
And this thought comforted me.

508
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,960
I'm so excited right now.

509
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:47,359
I have a reason to beat up someone.

510
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,519
It's my first time beating someone up after I quit being a boxer,

511
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,680
so I'm thrilled.

512
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,720
Look.

513
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,640
Can't we...

514
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,000
just talk it out?

515
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,079
- Please? - Hey, you're a doctor.

516
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,079
So dodge and make sure you're not critically injured, okay?

517
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,359
Do you know how upset my family was because of you?

518
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,079
Gosh, I'm really sorry.

519
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,960
You should've bought the Hanwoo beef. Do you look down on us?

520
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,039
Oh, that...

521
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,559
Shin Jae Rim bought that.

522
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,240
Of course, I would've bought premium Hanwoo.

523
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,839
Jae Rim bought it? Then why did you act like you bought it?

524
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,440
She asked me to.

525
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:31,440
She said the family would be uncomfortable if they found out.

526
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,960
She said she wanted to do it for the family...

527
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,920
and asked me to pretend I bought it.

528
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
But...

529
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,279
she said it had to be imported beef because you eat a lot.

530
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,720
- What? - She said you'd eat a lot,

531
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,279
- so it had to be imported beef. - Darn you little...

532
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,720
I'm sorry. I apologize.

533
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,759
What about the yoga clothes and the massage oil?

534
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,599
That was her too.

535
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,400
Gosh, this is really annoying.

536
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,400
Then who owes whom?

537
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,079
Jae Rim borrowed money from me,

538
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,440
but I let her boss me around.

539
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,119
It's so strange, isn't it?

540
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,200
You little...

541
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,839
Darn it!

542
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,799
The money Jae Rim owes you.

543
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,960
She'll pay you back.

544
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,480
She's still young and doesn't really have any skills yet,

545
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,880
but she'll become competent soon.

546
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,559
That's how I raised her. To be strong...

547
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,000
and survive no matter what.

548
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,519
So, get the money from her.

549
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:23,880
Are you leaving?

550
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:30,880
I'm suddenly craving Hanwoo.

551
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,319
Guys, your decision to lend someone money...

552
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,559
could lead to such scary consequences.

553
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,920
I feel like it's colder in here than it is outside.

554
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,799
It's because there's no furnace.

555
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,960
Come here and sit on this heated blanket.

556
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:00,559
- Okay, just for a few minutes. - Sure.

557
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,440
Cover yourself with this,

558
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,119
or you'll freeze to death.

559
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,480
So, what do you think?

560
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,359
You're poorer than I thought.

561
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,759
I didn't know I was this poor either.

562
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:25,559
Anyway, can you really sleep here?

563
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,559
Yes. Why can't I do it when you can do it?

564
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,200
You should go to my place.

565
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,519
We won't sleep together here, right?

566
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,839
(Public Safety Alert)

567
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,400
(Heavy Snow Warning)

568
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,559
Can't we just go together?

569
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,480
We can swap places another time. Okay?

570
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,000
No, that's not right. I can't back out just because it's cold.

571
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
I'll sleep here.

572
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,960
Hey, seriously... My gosh.

573
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:12,039
- Then I'll stay too. - Why?

574
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:13,880
I feel bad leaving you alone here.

575
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,880
Honestly, I've never slept alone here when it was this cold.

576
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,400
On such cold days,

577
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,360
my dad and I kept each other warm.

578
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,119
It's such an old house,

579
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,119
so it could collapse, and we might actually freeze to death.

580
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:44,719
Change of plans. Retreat.

581
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,840
We're pulling out. Let's just go to my place.

582
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:48,360
Really?

583
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,400
What do I do?

584
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,119
What do you want to do?

585
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,559
Well, first...

586
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,159
I want to take a hot shower.

587
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,519
I couldn't take a shower in the morning.

588
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:41,679
Clearly, I made a bad judgment call.

589
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,519
I can't believe I thought I could take cold showers.

590
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,769
Hot water is essential.

591
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:47,679
My, look at this.

592
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,519
The cells in my body are so happy that they're dancing like this.

593
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,360
Pop.

594
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,639
I'm a slave to these pleasures.

595
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,960
Oh, how do I turn off the water?

596
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,719
Is this super high-tech?

597
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,119
Turn off the water, please.

598
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,639
Oh, no. What should I do?

599
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:14,239
What if I cause a flood in this luxury condo?

600
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,960
(Compensation for Damage: 50,000 Dollars)

601
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,809
I'm sorry for always making you see things you aren't supposed to see.

602
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:31,719
Don't worry. I won't see anything.

603
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,440
Well, there isn't really anything you shouldn't see.

604
00:36:35,769 --> 00:36:37,400
If this were a movie, even children could see this.

605
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,360
Hey, move over.

606
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,360
(Tub Supply, Stop)

607
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,840
I see. That's how you turn it off.

608
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,480
Gosh.

609
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,679
Are you all right?

610
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,400
Your face is red.

611
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,960
It hurts so much.

612
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,199
My butt.

613
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,639
Oh, sorry.

614
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,840
Oh, I'm fine.

615
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:22,719
No, not like this.

616
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:25,840
You must cherish what is precious to you.

617
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,289
No. Just go for it. Please!

618
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,119
(Kang Hwa Jin)

619
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:49,559
Hello?

620
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:51,769
I'm having some beef as my late-night snack, so come over.

621
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,239
It'll be gone if you don't come now.

622
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:54,960
Who's calling her at this hour?

623
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Is it...

624
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:03,360
Baek Ddong?

625
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,960
Mom, try this.

626
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,079
No, I don't want to eat.

627
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:20,599
What if Jae Rim didn't even have dinner?

628
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,289
I can't eat.

629
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:26,719
I told Jae Rim to come over and join us.

630
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,400
Really? Is she coming?

631
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,239
I'm sure she'll be here. Beef is calling her.

632
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:32,400
Beef won't do.

633
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:33,960
I should make some fresh kimchi.

634
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,400
Why does she want to eat meat in the middle of the night?

635
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,289
What's going on? Did something happen?

636
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:47,719
I have to go.

637
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:48,769
Now? I mean...

638
00:39:49,769 --> 00:39:50,769
You'll leave now?

639
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:53,679
Yes. Thank you for everything today,

640
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:54,809
but I have to go.

641
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:05,559
Don't go.

642
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,960
Stay with me.
