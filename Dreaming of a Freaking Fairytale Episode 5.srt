00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.638


00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.240
A kiss symbolizes a happy ending.

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.640
Why is it that a kiss can put an end to it all...

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:19.160
in every fairy tale?

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:26.000
We all know that it's never that simple in real life.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.209
A kiss is just the beginning.

(Romantic Butterfly Effects)

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.079
My gosh! What is this?

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:45.200
Seriously! What is the matter with you?

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.520
(Follow Your Joy)

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.399
Just tell her to clean this up and let it go.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.000
I think it was a mistake.

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:07.409
You're living like a loser because you make mistakes like this.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.519
Why did you make a mistake like this?

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.079
Mistakes like this will pile up and turn into a serious problem.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.719
I like...

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.000
the mint chocolate flavor.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.520
Hey, why didn't you say anything?

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.240
You should've talked back, like you do with me.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.520
This time, I did make a mistake,

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.680
and I'm just an employee after all.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.120
Yes, exactly.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.959
Only I can pick on my employees.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.400
Why let them yell at you?

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.280
Anyway, are you all right?

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:31.800
Oh, that.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.479
I think my impacted wisdom tooth here popped out.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.198
I don't think she slapped you that hard.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:42.840
Do you think she's Shohei Ohtani or something?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.759
- Anyway, why do you ask? - Because I was worried.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.400
Well, you should go to your fiancee.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.199
She seemed furious.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.439
She has anger management issues.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.240
No one knows when or what would make her blow her fuse.

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.240
She's like a booby trap filled with anger.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.960
Well... Did she not like my outfit today or something?

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.479
I bet she stormed out because she was flustered after slapping me.

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:14.759
Yes, exactly.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.240
She must be flustered.

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.730
Ask her why she's flustered and if she's okay. Go check in on her.

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:23.360
She is your fiancee, after all.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.610
Go and find her. I'm really okay.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.050
It is true that she is my fiancee,

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.439
but we aren't in love.

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:52.360
I'm not obligated to comfort her when she's upset.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.759
We're just like business partners.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.759
You know I don't really care about my business.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.800
You see, for me...

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.439
What I'm worried about is whether or not you're okay.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.079
So, remove that stain and come out.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.480
Oh, right.

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:27.399
By the way, that outfit suits you.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.199
Why is Mr. Moon...

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.000
suddenly nice to me?

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.600
(Chungdam Heaven)

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.079
Hey, let's talk.

00:05:58.759 --> 00:05:59.800
Why did you do that?

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:02.240
I can't stand seeing you look out for someone else.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.120
Then stop coming here...

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.040
because I'll continue to look out for her.

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:08.599
Shall I slap you on the other cheek too?

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.839
You said we should help her become Cinderella so she'd leave.

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:14.040
I'll play the darned witch in the story of Cinderella.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.240
You must've lost your mind.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.160
Seriously, why are you being like this?

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.560
Does a lunatic have a reason for what he does?

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:26.479
I'm just doing this because I'm a lunatic.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.360
Oh, I see. Is that so?

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:31.480
I turn into a lunatic often too, so this is great.

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:33.000
Hey, by the way,

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.199
why do you keep getting worked up over my problems?

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.319
It's making me uncomfortable.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.600
Look who's talking!

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.680
Don't ask a lunatic why she's behaving a certain way.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.800
Dan A.

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:48.279
You're not a Chihuahua.

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.079
Will you bite and chew up everything you don't like?

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.720
Oh, boy.

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:09.519
I wonder if I could somehow take her to Kang Hyung Wook.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.639
You're really something.

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:26.800
You can do whatever you want with your business.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.839
This is a high-class cultural club.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.680
The owner trying to protect his employee's pride first?

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:33.519
It's unheard of.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.199
Of course, I should protect my people first.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.639
There's no other reason?

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:41.079
Should there be another reason?

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.879
You see, men like us...

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.399
should never date a woman like her...

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:50.958
because it won't be that simple. You'd have to break social order,

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:53.240
which will be quite difficult to do.

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:56.360
Why do you assume that I'll find it difficult?

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.360
Because you look like a delicate greenhouse flower.

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:01.600
Me?

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.040
Thank you.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.800
That means I look pure and innocent, right?

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:07.920
Do you think I'm joking now?

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:10.600
Someone told me that it was a disease...

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:12.759
to take things too seriously.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.920
Do you like her?

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:18.600
First off...

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.600
Mr. Baek Do Hong, why are you being like this?

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:27.839
Don't tell me...

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:33.960
that you like me.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.720
Don't fancy me. Just don't go there, okay?

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.919
You and I are very different anyway.

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:06.329
You're embarrassed of me, aren't you?

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.959
That is not what I meant.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.359
Don't deny it.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.559
I told you that you'll get nothing out of dating this loser.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.879
Hey, Min Ji.

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:20.638
- Let's go. - Okay. Let's go, Sung Jae.

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:22.840
(The 34th White Dragon Film Festival)

00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:33.039
I will not lose again.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.120
I was too flustered earlier.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.639
I'm sorry I ruined the party for you.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.799
I'll pay to get your clothes dry-cleaned.

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:49.120
It's fine. Why are you apologizing?

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:52.639
And let's be honest. I pushed you.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.600
Saying sorry even when you did nothing wrong.

00:09:58.759 --> 00:10:00.679
It's what poor people do.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.119
Do they think they owe an apology for being poor?

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.759
They apologize all the time.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.278
People who have power just don't do that.

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:09.720
Look at me. I'm always confident even after being mean to others.

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:16.399
Apologizing doesn't lessen my value,

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:18.330
so it's fine.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.240
You're right.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.759
Your value will never change much.

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:25.960
It won't change very much no matter what you do.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.960
So, give up on Baek Do Hong,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.639
or you'll hurt yourself while chasing him.

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:35.720
Director Baek!

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.799
I guess I don't deserve to meet successful people...

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.840
or change for the better.

00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:07.639
Is this how my life will be until the day I die?

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.440
Being belittled right and left.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.000
A loser who will always be a loser.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.600
What's wrong? Did something happen?

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.120
I should not explode,

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.279
so I'm trying to suppress my anger.

00:11:28.759 --> 00:11:30.440
I should hold back my anger to earn money.

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:33.079
After all, I get paid to put up with humiliation.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.759
I never said I'd pay you for doing that, so don't hold back.

00:11:37.159 --> 00:11:38.519
You matter too.

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:40.679
It's fine.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.159
Who is it? Come with me.

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:49.720
This place...

00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:52.919
The world...

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:55.320
is such an unfair place.

00:11:59.679 --> 00:12:00.879
Since I was born into this world,

00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:04.480
I wanted to live a good life like everyone else.

00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:08.279
All my life, I got stomped on like this floor.

00:12:08.759 --> 00:12:10.159
I didn't want that anymore,

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.440
so I started having such grand, unrealistic dreams,

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:18.759
but the world keeps putting me back in my place.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.559
You see, men like us...

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:23.399
should never date a woman like her...

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:25.559
because it won't be that simple.

00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:26.959
You'd have to break social order,

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.919
which will be quite difficult to do.

00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:32.798
I thought things could change a little...

00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:34.440
once I joined Chungdam Heaven.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.440
But this place is no different.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.440
I'll help you change.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.799
If you want it, close your eyes.

00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:57.840
Your value will never change much.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.360
It won't change very much no matter what you do.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.679
Do whatever you want.

00:14:27.919 --> 00:14:31.600
(Chungdam Heaven)

00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:33.759
What could change...

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.840
after a kiss?

00:14:40.759 --> 00:14:43.480
Mr. Moon, you've changed.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.440
You said you hated my dreams.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.879
So why are you helping me?

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.120
Because I don't hate you.

00:14:57.399 --> 00:14:59.639
Turn your dreams into reality and receive love...

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.679
from others.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.759
You told me about the innate right to be loved.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.720
I'll help you...

00:15:11.919 --> 00:15:13.720
so you can be loved and no longer feel sad.

00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:21.200
Oh, I see. So you're saying...

00:15:22.159 --> 00:15:23.799
you pity me.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.399
- You said to do whatever I wanted. - I never said you could kiss me.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.399
You didn't know I was going to kiss you?

00:15:29.919 --> 00:15:31.519
I thought you'd fake it.

00:15:31.799 --> 00:15:34.479
How could you actually kiss me? We're nothing.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.240
You did it for real, so I followed.

00:15:37.159 --> 00:15:39.200
You were very enthusiastic.

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:41.639
My gosh. When? Don't be ridiculous.

00:15:41.679 --> 00:15:43.479
Gosh, this is really frustrating.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.919
I wish we could hit rewind and check.

00:15:49.039 --> 00:15:50.120
Shall we rewind?

00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:55.960
Stop joking with me.

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:58.840
How am I going to face the members?

00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:01.758
I must've been out of my mind earlier...

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:03.599
because I was having a mental breakdown, but...

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.919
And I was definitely in my right mind.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.720
It was all intentional.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.038
Now, they'll remember you as the woman who won the heart...

00:16:09.039 --> 00:16:10.320
of the Chungdam Heaven CEO.

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:12.960
Other men will be interested in you now, no?

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.279
Oh, you think so?

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.960
I am much obliged.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.480
No.

00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:20.320
Did you mean to say you were ecstatic?

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.240
Very ecstatic, indeed.

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:28.279
Goodness.

00:16:28.919 --> 00:16:30.559
Hey, where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

00:16:30.879 --> 00:16:32.639
No, thank you. I can go home alone.

00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:35.279
You have the corporate credit card, right?

00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:37.039
Take a deluxe taxi!

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.159
Yes, I will take the most expensive taxi!

00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:43.159
(Deluxe Taxi)

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.360
Snap out of it.

00:16:49.879 --> 00:16:50.960
Don't be excited.

00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:57.080
I feel like my lips have a heart of their own.

00:16:57.519 --> 00:16:58.559
Are you all right, miss?

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.600
Oh. Yes, I'm fine.

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:08.039
- What? - What?

00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:09.279
What?

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.169
By any chance, weren't you driving the van...

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.440
I've only driven deluxe taxis.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.680
Well, can I ask you something? What's your opinion...

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.519
on a man who kisses a woman he doesn't even like?

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.119
Shall I kill him?

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.838
Such a frivolous-minded jerk...

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:32.599
deserves to be run over with a heavy car like this.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.119
Oh, no. He's not that bad.

00:17:35.799 --> 00:17:38.519
The kiss felt nice at least.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.039
I guess he's handsome,

00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:41.599
like me.

00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:56.319
(Chungdam Heaven)

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.000
I...

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.410
think of women as lifeless stones.

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:02.559
I am incredibly patient and...

00:18:06.039 --> 00:18:07.119
Do whatever you want.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:19.559
Darn it, seriously!

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.079
Go away, dirty thoughts!

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.119
("The Lord's Great Love")

00:18:27.119 --> 00:18:31.119
(Chungdam Heaven)

00:18:31.599 --> 00:18:35.519
Let your

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.119
Turbulent mind

00:18:39.559 --> 00:18:44.119
Be filled

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:48.720
With the Lord's great love

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.759
Amen.

00:18:51.359 --> 00:18:52.480
Hallelujah.

00:18:54.519 --> 00:18:55.720
("The Lord's Great Love")

00:18:58.599 --> 00:19:01.200
I see that his heart is full of a different kind of love.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.170
Will I really...

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.079
be able to see you date another man?

00:19:27.759 --> 00:19:29.799
Get out. Why are you sitting in the driver's seat?

00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:33.480
You called for a relief driver, right?

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:42.078
- Oh, this looks delicious. - I know.

00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:43.759
Just enjoy it, and you won't gain weight.

00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:49.039
Hi, Dan A. You're here.

00:19:50.039 --> 00:19:52.799
Well, we're having a late-night snack.

00:19:53.079 --> 00:19:54.200
Do you want to join us?

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.410
No, you eat it all!

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:00.000
Can you actually swallow that now?

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.440
I never told you not to eat it!

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:06.039
Darn it.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.599
Hey, uncles! I'm so sad right now.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.240
How could you have sweet and sour pork now?

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.038
No, we're going to throw this into the compost bin.

00:20:22.039 --> 00:20:23.759
We're done. We're putting this away.

00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:25.680
Hey, wait.

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:28.200
Oh, boy.

00:20:28.839 --> 00:20:30.200
I couldn't have a single bite.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.440
It's okay.

00:20:33.519 --> 00:20:35.170
You know, when we used to do fieldwork,

00:20:35.519 --> 00:20:37.358
we were called to the scenes...

00:20:37.359 --> 00:20:39.039
every time we sat down to eat jjajangmyeon.

00:20:39.519 --> 00:20:41.759
You're making it sound like we were cops or something.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.200
We were just busy whacking idiots.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.839
Right! But...

00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:47.439
these days, we even let Dan A lash out at us.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.650
Can you believe it?

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.720
You're right. We're too nice now.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:52.410
Something must be done.

00:20:52.411 --> 00:20:54.680
What happened that she's so upset?

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.519
Find out and take care of it.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680
Yes, sir.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.680
Oh, boy. What a waste.

00:21:00.279 --> 00:21:02.039
Why did you put the sweet and sour pork at the bottom?

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.680
Even dogs wouldn't want to eat this.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.199
Hey, let's not waste this. Eat up.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.410
Has anyone told you that you look like Cho Jung Seok?

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.999
Mom, I like Cho Jung Seok.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.038
- Me too. - So do I.

00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:13.758
- I'm home. - My gosh. You're so handsome.

00:21:13.759 --> 00:21:14.919
Jae Rim, you're home.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.000
Jae Rim, this is Soo Jin's colleague.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.279
He likes Soo Jin.

00:21:24.279 --> 00:21:26.319
Nice to meet you. I'm Gu Nam Hoon.

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:28.920
Just call me Dr. Gu.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.480
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

00:21:34.839 --> 00:21:36.410
My gosh. Look at these.

00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:40.039
I really wasn't going to accept these gifts,

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:42.650
but he picked out such perfect gifts for us.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.650
Mom, I only accepted them because you like them.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.960
My, it's lovely to see a mother and daughter get along so well.

00:21:49.319 --> 00:21:52.079
It wouldn't be possible if you weren't such a cool mom.

00:21:52.319 --> 00:21:55.519
You should give yourself a massage every day with this body oil.

00:21:55.599 --> 00:21:57.518
Remember, it's important to maintain healthy circulation...

00:21:57.519 --> 00:21:58.680
during pregnancy.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.039
A massage...

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:03.880
feels nicer when you get it from someone else.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.599
I'll give you massages from now on.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.960
You? Why?

00:22:15.359 --> 00:22:18.480
It should be done by someone with a strong grip.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.159
Mom, I'll do it for you.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.960
Go and catch a bull or something with those hands.

00:22:23.079 --> 00:22:25.518
I should beat you up before I do that!

00:22:25.519 --> 00:22:28.240
- What? - Jae Rim, do you want some food?

00:22:28.319 --> 00:22:30.078
Dr. Gu also brought some beef.

00:22:30.079 --> 00:22:32.118
He said it was important to get enough high-quality protein...

00:22:32.119 --> 00:22:33.680
and iron during pregnancy. My gosh.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.480
But it's not the Hanwoo beef.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.519
So there are some leftovers.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.920
Here.

00:22:54.359 --> 00:22:56.160
(Hwaryong Hapkido)

00:22:57.759 --> 00:22:58.880
One more round.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.960
Hey.

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:03.118
Are you trying to tire yourself out because you're stressed?

00:23:03.119 --> 00:23:04.519
That's even worse than stress.

00:23:04.759 --> 00:23:06.240
I bet you think it's okay because this is a sport.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.559
Once you get your knees busted, it can't be undone.

00:23:10.839 --> 00:23:13.119
What's going on? Tell me?

00:23:14.759 --> 00:23:16.559
Why, you little...

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.480
Tell me honestly, or I won't release you.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.720
- Well, there's someone I like. - Okay.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.400
But I won't like her.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.279
- Gosh. - Why not?

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.839
- Is she married? - No.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.319
Her dream is to become Cinderella and turn her life around.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.160
Okay, she's weird.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.200
My mom was like that.

00:23:43.319 --> 00:23:46.400
She's a lot like my mom.

00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:51.759
My mom...

00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:54.518
got a divorce and left with a fortune in the end.

00:23:54.519 --> 00:23:55.839
You know, I get it.

00:23:56.119 --> 00:23:57.480
Following money and love.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.079
Going to a better place. That's all okay, but...

00:24:02.599 --> 00:24:04.000
it left my dad devastated.

00:24:06.839 --> 00:24:07.880
I...

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:12.359
don't want my dad's life.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.440
But as you know,

00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:16.599
you're a lot like your father.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.960
No.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.240
I'll send her to the kind of wonderful man she wants to be with.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.799
What are you, a new kind of pervert?

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.279
Letting her go and missing her would be better...

00:24:27.519 --> 00:24:29.000
than resenting her after being abandoned.

00:24:32.359 --> 00:24:33.839
That will be a win-win for everyone.

00:24:34.839 --> 00:24:35.839
Oh, boy.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.880
Come on, one more round.

00:24:38.359 --> 00:24:39.359
Goodness.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.640
All he has to do is just let himself like her,

00:24:51.759 --> 00:24:53.679
but he's intentionally tiring himself out not to do that.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.720
Just use that energy...

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.359
to love her!

00:25:30.039 --> 00:25:31.240
What's up?

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.960
Don't people say hello to each other when they meet?

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.160
Are you still mad at me?

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.799
No, I'm not mad. I'm just...

00:25:41.759 --> 00:25:42.759
I'm just a little...

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.759
embarrassed, that's all.

00:25:48.839 --> 00:25:50.279
How about you? Are you all right?

00:25:51.599 --> 00:25:52.839
What? Oh...

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.880
As you know, I'm very laid-back.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.759
I don't really care about such things.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.879
You should be cool about it too. Don't worry.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.319
Relax and just be yourself.

00:26:05.119 --> 00:26:07.000
Oh, I see.

00:26:07.319 --> 00:26:08.799
I don't really care either.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.598
Life keeps me so busy...

00:26:10.599 --> 00:26:12.359
that those things don't mean much to me.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.960
About that, I'll just think that I ate a big innkeeper worm.

00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:20.440
What? "Innkeeper worm?"

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.920
That was not an innkeeper worm.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.518
Why? The innkeeper worms from Jeju are meaty and delicious.

00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:28.680
I wish they were easier to get.

00:26:28.839 --> 00:26:29.839
Really?

00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:34.039
So, I'm such a rarity, like the innkeeper worm.

00:26:35.799 --> 00:26:36.799
Actually, no.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.000
It had no nutritional value.

00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:46.960
Nutritional... What?

00:26:53.559 --> 00:26:57.359
(Innkeeper worm)

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:03.640
I can't believe she compared my first kiss to an innkeeper worm.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.319
It's from our newest collection.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.880
This design is perfect for men with nice bodies, like your groom-to-be.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.240
What do you think?

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:21.960
Don't be ridiculous.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.880
Don't get clingy just because we kissed once.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.680
Your kiss...

00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:35.880
sucked.

00:27:46.759 --> 00:27:48.519
Mr. Groom.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.439
Would you like to go with this tuxedo?

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.559
I don't need this.

00:27:51.799 --> 00:27:54.079
Fix this first. My butt cheeks are literally eating the pants!

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.119
(Chungdam Heaven)

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:11.119
He seemed totally fine.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.319
It only kept me up all night.

00:28:22.839 --> 00:28:24.160
You know, last night...

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.999
Toward the end of the party,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.359
there was a special event none of the employees knew about.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.559
Oh, that.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.960
I didn't know about it either. I'm an employee too, you know.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.440
Did anything else happen after that?

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.079
No, nothing happened.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.799
That's strange.

00:28:46.119 --> 00:28:47.440
Did you enjoy the kiss at least?

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.960
Well, it was just...

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.440
I don't know. I wasn't thinking anything at that moment.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.960
So, you were in a trance.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.160
There are rumors about your secret relationship. Is it true?

00:29:00.279 --> 00:29:02.839
- No, it's not true. - Then what happened last night?

00:29:03.079 --> 00:29:04.919
Ms. Shin wants to meet her Prince Charming like Cinderella.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.959
But she seemed lost, so I was simply trying to help her.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.839
But you're not like that normally. Don't you think you went overboard?

00:29:10.079 --> 00:29:11.719
That moment, I didn't realize I was going overboard.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.839
I'm really sorry.

00:29:13.279 --> 00:29:15.400
Do you want to look cool all the time? That's like a disease.

00:29:15.799 --> 00:29:17.480
I never thought it could be a disease.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.640
Please note that I was drinking when it happened.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.599
As if that will be considered a mitigating factor.

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:24.880
They say a drunk man always tells the truth.

00:29:25.319 --> 00:29:26.798
I wasn't that drunk.

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:28.160
Come on. Look.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.640
Do you have a split personality?

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.480
I'll see a psychiatrist for an in-depth assessment.

00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:36.598
- So, it's true. - A hundred percent.

00:29:36.599 --> 00:29:39.160
Our Prince Cha Min, the eighth-generation heir.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.078
Since when was he...

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:42.759
- so petty-minded? - Stop recording.

00:29:46.279 --> 00:29:49.519
Mr. Moon, your problem is that you don't know what women want.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.799
Then what should I do?

00:29:55.839 --> 00:29:57.920
To win a lady's heart,

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.000
- you need tteokbokki. - Tteokbokki?

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.880
Even all the fancy restaurants sell tteokbokki these days.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.558
We should also...

00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:10.720
add tteokbokki to our regular menu at Chungdam Heaven.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.240
Try it.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.440
Okay.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.359
I know I made this, but it's so good. My gosh.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.279
But this...

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.440
also has no nutritional value, just like a kiss. Am I wrong?

00:30:29.119 --> 00:30:30.160
What?

00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:33.440
A kiss and tteokbokki nurture the mind.

00:30:33.799 --> 00:30:35.559
It feels your heart with joy.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.839
No way.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.680
It's too spicy.

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:55.559
Jae Rim.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.519
Hi.

00:31:03.839 --> 00:31:04.880
Hello.

00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:08.000
Would you like me to introduce you to the other members over there?

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.559
Or I'll give you a cup of tea.

00:31:12.759 --> 00:31:14.480
I want to have a talk with you today, Jae Rim.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.119
- Ouch, it's hot. - Are you all right?

00:31:17.799 --> 00:31:19.400
I'm fine. I only spilled a little bit.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.960
I'll just have a glass of ice water.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.880
Oh, really?

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.680
It's hot in here, isn't it?

00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:38.119
I'm fine.

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:39.599
It's red.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.759
You need to cool it down right away.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.440
Anyway,

00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:48.920
what's going on between you and Mr. Moon?

00:31:54.039 --> 00:31:56.119
Nothing. He's just my boss.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.880
Then what was that last night?

00:32:00.799 --> 00:32:01.799
What happened?

00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:03.880
Was he abusing his power?

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:06.319
His drunken habit, I guess?

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.399
Rumor has it that he does...

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.519
a lot of ridiculous things when he gets drunk.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.400
- Ridiculous things? - Yes.

00:32:14.119 --> 00:32:15.319
Well, for example...

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.359
Whenever he gets drunk,

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.439
he kisses every utility pole in Cheongdam-dong,

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.920
apparently.

00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:24.839
Isn't it so ridiculous?

00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:36.279
Hey, how come your lips are so dry?

00:32:36.839 --> 00:32:38.079
You didn't put on any lip balm?

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.559
You're so cute.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.960
You're wearing a headband today.

00:32:43.759 --> 00:32:46.599
(Utility Pole Collector)

00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:51.119
Did you come here to ask me about this?

00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:53.759
No, I'm going to ask you other questions too.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.680
About what?

00:32:56.759 --> 00:32:57.799
About you.

00:33:00.279 --> 00:33:02.640
I want to know more about you, Jae Rim.

00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:07.960
So how about we meet at my studio next time instead of here?

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.759
Why should I meet you at your studio?

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.640
There's something I want to show you.

00:33:28.519 --> 00:33:29.599
This is your invitation.

00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:31.400
Wear it when you come to my studio.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.960
Yesterday, you went ahead and broke the order I talked about.

00:34:03.119 --> 00:34:04.920
Why should I follow your order?

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.160
You're right.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.960
So I'm going to play this game for real now.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.519
I won't hesitate to cross the line.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:14.679
That will be fun.

00:34:16.519 --> 00:34:18.599
Was the kiss with Jae Rim fun too?

00:34:18.769 --> 00:34:21.360
Hey, come on. Don't pry,

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:23.360
- or you'll get hurt. - The same goes for you.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.289
Don't do that again.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:34.360
Who do you think you are?

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:37.769
Just wait and see.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:40.559
To find out what I'm capable of.

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:47.599
I don't know what he'll see,

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:48.960
but my eyes...

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.480
are delighted as I'm watching the two of them.

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:57.518
You totally bit the bait.

00:34:57.519 --> 00:34:59.078
This was the big picture I had in mind.

00:34:59.079 --> 00:35:00.959
How could you take the bait right away just as I'd expected?

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.288
Now, you're attracted to the girl I kissed?

00:35:02.289 --> 00:35:03.439
Of course, you are! This is great.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.288
Things are panning out exactly according to my plan.

00:35:05.289 --> 00:35:06.960
Baek Do Hong, that idiot.

00:35:07.769 --> 00:35:10.880
Honestly, I don't know who's a real idiot here.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.199
Why is Baek Do Hong...

00:35:32.559 --> 00:35:34.769
suddenly showing interest in me again?

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.119
Is the universe still working to make my wish come true?

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.559
Or...

00:35:41.159 --> 00:35:43.809
is it really because of the kiss?

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.559
- Jae Rim! - What?

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:57.199
What were you thinking about? You look so spaced out.

00:35:57.289 --> 00:35:59.119
No, I wasn't thinking about anything.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.480
Jae Rim.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.769
- So, what are you going to do? - About what?

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.999
I think Mr. Moon really likes you.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.239
He's acting like that to make me quit.

00:36:10.769 --> 00:36:12.439
He'd feel bad if he had to kick me out,

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.809
so he wants me to leave of my own accord.

00:36:14.039 --> 00:36:15.039
No.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.440
He's overly sensitive and fickle...

00:36:16.441 --> 00:36:18.239
when dealing with matters that involve you.

00:36:18.289 --> 00:36:20.119
Trust me. He's not like that normally.

00:36:20.289 --> 00:36:21.808
In the past, he was crazy but straightforward.

00:36:21.809 --> 00:36:24.638
Like a kind bully...

00:36:24.639 --> 00:36:26.119
or an innocent pervert?

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.880
I suppose Mr. Moon was like the unicorn in the past.

00:36:29.329 --> 00:36:31.440
Why don't we go and summon the unicorn again?

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.480
Let's test him.

00:36:36.519 --> 00:36:38.769
Mr. Moon, I brought you some snack.

00:36:42.079 --> 00:36:43.329
What's with that hairpin?

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.638
Are you from North Korea or something?

00:36:45.639 --> 00:36:49.039
Oh, this. Mr. Baek Do Hong gave me this.

00:36:49.719 --> 00:36:50.809
I knew it.

00:36:51.199 --> 00:36:54.159
So? What did you and Baek Ddong talk about?

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.480
"Baek Ddong?"

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.158
Baek... As in, "White Poop?"

00:36:58.159 --> 00:36:59.359
Try saying "Baek Do Hong" quickly.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.399
Baek Do Hong...

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.199
Baek Do Hong, Baek Ddong.

00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:04.599
- Right? - Goodness.

00:37:05.559 --> 00:37:06.840
It's "Baek Do Hong."

00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:09.719
Baek Do Hong, Baek Ddong...

00:37:12.679 --> 00:37:14.769
Stop making fun of his name. It's a nice name.

00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:16.679
You're so mean.

00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:18.159
Fine.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.360
What did Mr. Baek Do Hong with such a nice name say to you?

00:37:22.199 --> 00:37:23.329
You want to know what he said?

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.440
Yes.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.639
Your spontaneous act must've really worked.

00:37:34.519 --> 00:37:35.639
He...

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.639
invited me to his studio.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.400
What? His studio? Why?

00:37:41.679 --> 00:37:42.769
What does he want to do there with you?

00:37:44.119 --> 00:37:45.769
That I don't know.

00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:50.360
Hey. You're going to act all naive and go there, aren't you?

00:37:50.599 --> 00:37:51.639
Yes, of course.

00:37:51.809 --> 00:37:53.038
I'll act all naive and coy...

00:37:53.039 --> 00:37:54.809
and go there as if I know nothing.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.719
Isn't this what you wanted?

00:38:08.039 --> 00:38:09.879
All of this happened...

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.769
because your kiss really worked.

00:38:13.519 --> 00:38:16.599
But I think there are some adverse effects too.

00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:18.119
Adverse effects? Like what?

00:38:19.289 --> 00:38:20.329
You should take responsibility.

00:38:21.519 --> 00:38:22.840
For what?

00:38:27.519 --> 00:38:28.519
Let's...

00:38:32.159 --> 00:38:33.440
kiss just once more.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.159
There's something I want to know...

00:38:38.679 --> 00:38:40.119
before I visit his studio.

00:38:41.039 --> 00:38:43.199
Why? What is it?

00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:45.599
Why should we kiss again?

00:38:47.199 --> 00:38:48.519
Because it was so strange.

00:38:52.119 --> 00:38:53.289
It was really odd,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.119
and that's why I want to experience it once more.

00:39:00.559 --> 00:39:01.880
Then I'll know better.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.079
- Do you really mean it? - Yes, I sure do.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.289
It's just the two of us here.

00:39:13.119 --> 00:39:14.440
So let's do it properly this time.

00:39:17.199 --> 00:39:19.079
- Won't you regret it? - No.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.159
If you want it, close your eyes.
