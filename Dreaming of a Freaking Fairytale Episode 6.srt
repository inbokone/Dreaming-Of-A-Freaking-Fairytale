00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,800
The prince and the princess are kissing.

3
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:15,181
The story...

4
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,142
that's about to unfold from now on isn't appropriate for children,

5
00:00:17,782 --> 00:00:19,461
so this is where the fairy tale ends.

6
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:21,023
With a happy ending, of course.

7
00:00:26,503 --> 00:00:28,782
Oh, right. This is a drama, not a fairy tale.

8
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:31,301
This is where Act Two begins.

00:00:31,302 --> 00:00:32,302
(Episode 6: The Sub's Counterattack)

10
00:00:32,303 --> 00:00:34,503
Guys, make sure you bring some popcorn.

11
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:41,672
Ask him to kiss you again.

12
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:44,632
If he really likes you, he won't be able to say no.

13
00:00:45,273 --> 00:00:46,473
Unlike your brain,

14
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:48,712
your body can't lie.

15
00:00:49,352 --> 00:00:52,072
Does he really have feelings for me?

16
00:00:55,712 --> 00:00:56,712
Yes.

17
00:00:57,672 --> 00:00:58,712
Let's find out.

18
00:01:04,873 --> 00:01:06,472
Oh, no. This should not happen.

19
00:01:08,312 --> 00:01:10,793
My dear mind, fight my instincts!

20
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:15,362
Find out what?

21
00:01:15,793 --> 00:01:16,832
What adverse effects?

22
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:19,073
You're talking nonsense.

23
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:21,271
Oh, boy! You must pull...

24
00:01:21,272 --> 00:01:22,633
the moment the fish bites the bait.

25
00:01:24,073 --> 00:01:25,192
Too bad.

26
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:28,433
You know what? Just forget it and go to Baek Do Hong's studio.

27
00:01:29,312 --> 00:01:30,312
For real?

28
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:33,392
Is that what you really want?

29
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:43,633
No.

30
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,392
I can't let you go like this.

31
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:01,153
Hurry up, will you?

32
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:02,272
I am coming.

33
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:05,633
My gosh.

34
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:07,552
Where are those two going this time?

35
00:02:08,353 --> 00:02:10,913
It looks like they get along really well.

36
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:15,872
I've decided to help you, so I should help you properly.

37
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:20,793
I'm your Fairy Godmother, you know.

38
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:22,112
And my magic is...

39
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,043
Money.

40
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:26,592
This boutique is all ours until midnight.

41
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:30,043
- Why? - "Why?" What do you think?

42
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:32,953
I want to send you to Baek Do Hong's studio in a nice outfit.

43
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:35,832
So, he really is determined to send me to him.

44
00:02:36,552 --> 00:02:37,552
All right?

45
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:40,633
No, thank you. I can just wear what I normally wear.

46
00:02:41,872 --> 00:02:43,953
You should be determined to seduce him if you're going there.

47
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:46,552
- Pick what you like. - No, I don't want to.

48
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:49,353
You don't need to feel bad. Just take it.

49
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:50,632
I have a lot of money, you see.

50
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:52,472
That's not why I'm saying no.

51
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:53,513
Then what is it?

52
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,473
I don't need stuff like this.

53
00:02:56,112 --> 00:02:57,392
Aren't I pretty already?

54
00:02:58,353 --> 00:02:59,992
No, you're not.

55
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:01,073
You need to make some effort.

56
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,193
Don't you want Baek Do Hong to fall hard for you?

57
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:07,753
Seriously,

58
00:03:08,353 --> 00:03:10,272
he's not interested in me at all.

59
00:03:11,073 --> 00:03:13,953
Fine. Then I shall show you the definition of sexy.

60
00:03:14,353 --> 00:03:15,353
What?

61
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:16,831
You're underestimating me. I didn't want to surprise you,

62
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:17,992
so I've been hiding it.

63
00:03:18,313 --> 00:03:19,313
Look.

64
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:20,832
Goodness. I'm not surprised at all.

65
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:22,233
You're hiding it really well.

66
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:23,872
Please show me, then.

67
00:03:23,992 --> 00:03:25,792
You're in for a big surprise.

68
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:27,431
I dress like this because I'm broke.

69
00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:29,073
It doesn't mean I have a bad fashion sense.

70
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,313
Hey, how do I look?

71
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:35,913
Who said you could talk so casually to me?

72
00:03:36,313 --> 00:03:38,473
You are wearing sequins from head to toe.

73
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,152
My gosh.

74
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:43,073
Then what do you think of this dress, sir?

75
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:45,592
I look pretty sexy in this, don't you think?

76
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:48,912
Your waist must be cold on both sides.

77
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:49,952
This is sexy.

78
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:51,353
You'll get an upset stomach if you eat in that dress.

79
00:03:51,672 --> 00:03:52,672
Pass.

80
00:03:53,672 --> 00:03:55,193
The perfect date outfit.

81
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:56,991
Ta-da.

82
00:03:56,992 --> 00:03:58,872
Is that a kids' top?

83
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,112
It looks way too small for you.

84
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:02,592
Do you really like that outfit?

85
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:07,232
Oh, can you move in that dress?

86
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:09,513
This isn't too tight. It's called fashion, you know.

87
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:12,353
- Isn't this pretty? - Hey, breathe.

88
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:16,193
Clearly, you do not have a good eye.

89
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,032
They say you must try on a lot of clothes to be fashionable.

90
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:20,792
You certainly have no idea what suits you and what doesn't.

91
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,272
There are times when you must listen to other people's advice.

92
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,753
Wear these.

93
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:30,912
You said you wanted to get married.

95
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:53,352
You really don't have to do this.

96
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:56,152
Here.

97
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:04,513
You bought way too many things. There's no room left.

98
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:06,633
You can make room. They'll all fit in the car.

99
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:10,592
Like I said, I'm your Fairy Godmother.

100
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:13,123
But I'm too sexy for a granny, right?

101
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:16,032
Don't worry. This is no big deal.

102
00:05:18,392 --> 00:05:19,911
Darn you, Fairy Godmother.

103
00:05:19,912 --> 00:05:21,232
Please take her home safe and sound.

104
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:22,953
Sim sala bim!

105
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:25,003

107
00:05:36,392 --> 00:05:38,032
What am I going to do with all these clothes?

108
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:42,633
Gosh, seriously.

109
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:46,832
Wear the clothes you like only in front of me.

110
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:49,391
They look lame, but I can put up with them.

111
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:50,472
(They look lame, but I can put up with them.)

112
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:53,152
You think this is my style? You idiot.

113
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:57,633
I just meant that I didn't need to impress Baek Do Hong.

114
00:05:58,113 --> 00:05:59,232

00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,912
There's something I want to know...

119
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:17,792
before I visit his studio.

120
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:25,633
What did she want to know?

121
00:06:26,712 --> 00:06:29,272
I'm so curious that it's driving me nuts. Why is she off today?

122
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:30,753
Will she really go to his studio?

123
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:32,673
Life is all about timing, you know.

124
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:34,873
Shall I offer to tag along?

125
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:37,712
Well, I am her Fairy Godmother, so I should go and help her.

126
00:06:37,753 --> 00:06:40,993
Hey, Fairy Godmother. You need to know when to stay out of things.

127
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:42,553
Gosh.

128
00:06:48,832 --> 00:06:49,873
Gosh, you scared me.

129
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:51,912
Now, you regret it?

130
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:53,472
It's too late.

131
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:55,992
I'll go to Baek Do Hong's studio...

132
00:06:55,993 --> 00:06:57,993
and kiss him a hundred times.

133

143
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:26,472
Hello.

144
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:27,673
Welcome.

145
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:29,352
The food is ready.

146
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:31,831
What? You cooked?

147
00:07:31,832 --> 00:07:32,832
Of course.

148
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:35,193
Let's eat first. Then I'll give you a tour of my studio.

149
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:38,993
I don't want you to feel hungry, even for a second.

150
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:50,993
I wasn't expecting to have such a nice meal at your studio.

151
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:53,753
Anyway,

152
00:07:54,313 --> 00:07:57,272
why did you invite me to your studio?

153
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,193
I wanted to spend time with you and no one else.

154
00:08:07,712 --> 00:08:08,832
So, what do you think of my studio?

155
00:08:10,232 --> 00:08:11,232
Well...

156
00:08:12,912 --> 00:08:13,993
It's cool.

157
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:17,032
To tell you the truth, I was very curious.

158
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:20,352
You said you liked to draw.

159
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:23,792
Then how come you're not doing what you like?

160
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:30,953
Only the chosen ones...

161
00:08:31,313 --> 00:08:33,193
can make a living doing what they love.

162
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:35,752
You probably can't relate to it.

163
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:42,232
I know what you mean.

164
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:46,232
It was all luck that I could become...

165
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:48,673
a successful filmmaker.

166
00:08:50,712 --> 00:08:53,283
My parents helped me so I could do what I loved.

167
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:55,712
I enjoyed it, so I kept at it.

168

And that's how I gained my skills.

169
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:02,752
I see.

170
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:07,913
But I think...

171
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:11,512
working with you will become my favorite thing.

172
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,043
("Come to Me")

173
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:29,793
Work with me.

174
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:33,553
Go through my script and create a storyboard for it.

175
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:35,872
Me?

176
00:09:36,632 --> 00:09:38,832
I don't even know how to create a storyboard.

177
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:40,283
That's fine.

178
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:44,073
I'll help you, so you can take your time. Let's do it.

179
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,193
Let's do something we both love.

180
00:09:57,112 --> 00:09:59,553
My boss said the same thing.

181
00:10:01,313 --> 00:10:02,673
"Follow your joy."

182
00:10:05,283 --> 00:10:07,232
I guess that's how all successful people think.

183
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,043
Do not...

184
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:17,712
talk about your boss in front of me.

185
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:21,992
Don't you get it?

186
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:24,632
I keep trying...

187
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,872
to tell you that I like you, Jae Rim.

188
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:39,712
I don't know why I have to see you on my day off.

189
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,163
You asked me to take you out for a meal.

190
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:43,712
Well, you called me on my day off,

191
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:46,163
so I suggested we eat and talk instead of talking on the phone.

192
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:49,792
Hey, I called you by mistake because of my fat thumb.

193
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:51,752
Even so, you have to take responsibility for your action.

194
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,752
Gosh.

195
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,793
Why are all my employees like this?

196
00:10:57,352 --> 00:10:59,112
I know, I'm not cut out for working.

197
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:01,193
I want to get married soon and become a stay-at-home dad...

198
00:11:01,313 --> 00:11:02,352
but can't find a woman.

199
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:05,192
Hey, women are half the world.

200
00:11:05,193 --> 00:11:06,232
Why can't you find a woman?

201
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:08,712
Successful men have snatched them all up already. That's why.

202
00:11:09,553 --> 00:11:11,832
Oh, my friend told me...

203
00:11:11,913 --> 00:11:13,232
Baek Do Hong was a player too.

204
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:15,393
Rumor has it that he's a total womanizer.

205
00:11:15,712 --> 00:11:17,351
I heard he joined Chungdam Heaven...

206
00:11:17,352 --> 00:11:19,153
after dating every woman he met at clubs.

207
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:22,231
Is he leading Jae Rim on just to play her?

208
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:23,352
I'm a little worried,

209
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:26,232
but it'll probably be okay because Jae Rim can handle him.

210
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:29,313
- Young Bae. - Yes?

211
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:31,752
I can view the members' addresses on the app, right?

212
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:34,673
Well, yes.

213
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:36,752
Eat with your friend and put it on the corporate credit card.

214
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:45,073
This angle.

215
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,153
The way he's looking at me.

216
00:11:49,352 --> 00:11:51,673
He's definitely about to kiss me.

217
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,433
Is this really my wish coming true?

218
00:12:12,992 --> 00:12:15,073
Jae Rim, are you still hungry?

219
00:12:15,592 --> 00:12:18,273
No, that wasn't me.

220
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:20,832
It wasn't me either.

221
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:22,352
What?

222
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:29,393
Hey, little brother. You're having a good time,

223
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:31,793
so I was going to stay quiet, but I've been busted.

224
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:34,793
What are you doing here?

225
00:12:35,393 --> 00:12:36,552
You've been ignoring the whole family,

226
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:39,033
so I came here to see how well you were doing, all by yourself.

227
00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:40,992
What about the money I gave you? Did you spend it all?

228
00:12:41,752 --> 00:12:44,313
Hey, little brother. I thought...

229
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:47,232
it was my monthly allowance.

230
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,832
I clearly told you it was the last time.

231
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:56,193
- Anyway, get out. - Hey, let go.

232
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:58,793
Do you know what will happen if you keep ignoring me like this?

233
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:08,512
Miss, I overheard your conversation.

234
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:11,073
I must say, that punk lied to you, big-time.

235
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:12,553
I was baffled.

236
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:16,992
That punk isn't doing what he loves. He never has.

237
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:19,553
All his life, he's been doing what he thinks others would love.

238
00:13:19,992 --> 00:13:22,313
Right? Like a coward.

239
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:26,511
Come on. Get out.

240
00:13:26,512 --> 00:13:27,711
All right, let go.

241
00:13:27,712 --> 00:13:28,793
Hey, here.

242
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:33,153
Read this book. He wrote this.

243
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,393
I must say, it's a great book.

244
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:36,433
He made sure to include all the details women would love.

245
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:41,352
This made him the J. K. Rowling of BL novels.

246
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,192
That's how he made a fortune, doing shady stuff.

247
00:13:44,193 --> 00:13:46,953
Now, he calls himself a filmmaker, saying he wants to make art.

248
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:49,832
Even if he's moved up in the world, he's still third-rate. You know?

249
00:13:53,273 --> 00:13:55,472
I mean, this book is so third-rate...

250
00:13:55,953 --> 00:13:57,472
that I can never tell anyone my brother wrote it.

251
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:02,433
My gosh.

252
00:14:03,153 --> 00:14:06,193
Do Hong, you become successful in everything you do.

253
00:14:06,793 --> 00:14:07,832
I want to learn how you do it.

254
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:13,232
And you, Do Hong's brother.

255
00:14:14,673 --> 00:14:16,831
Your little brother worked hard to write this book.

256
00:14:16,832 --> 00:14:18,273
Why would you throw it?

257
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:21,073
And you're using it as leverage to extort money from him.

258
00:14:21,433 --> 00:14:22,752
I guess you have nothing better to do.

259
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,232
Gosh, she's really something.

260
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:28,112
Birds of a feather flock together, indeed.

261
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,673
- Get out. - You little...

262
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,752
- You love women too much. - Get out!

263
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:37,992
Gosh.

264
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:39,913
Okay, fine.

265
00:14:41,832 --> 00:14:43,033
Wait and see. You'll pay for this.

266
00:14:57,153 --> 00:14:58,512
Jae Rim, you should leave too.

267
00:15:00,553 --> 00:15:01,592
I'm sorry...

268
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:04,352
I disappointed you today.

269
00:15:05,073 --> 00:15:06,073
Yes.

270
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,832
Honestly, I didn't know you were like this.

271
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:12,793
What's wrong with BL novels?

272
00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:14,632
Is it illegal?

273
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,871
These days, it's hard to become a self-made man.

274
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:19,232
So, it's impressive that you became this successful all on your own.

275
00:15:19,673 --> 00:15:20,913
Why are you embarrassed?

276
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:27,033
- Shall I be honest? - Yes.

277
00:15:27,232 --> 00:15:28,673
I'm embarrassed to tell women about it.

278
00:15:29,832 --> 00:15:31,553
Even now, I'm embarrassed,

279
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:33,393
so please leave.

280
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:37,111
I guess you think I've seen it all.

281
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:38,232
You're treating me so rudely now.

282
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:40,592
I'm sorry.

283
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,033
Please don't tell anyone at Chungdam Heaven.

284
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:47,913
If people find out about this,

285
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:52,992
the members won't accept me.

286
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:55,273
Why do you think that?

287
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:56,433
You know the answer very well.

288
00:15:58,793 --> 00:15:59,992
They normally don't...

289
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:02,153
accept people like us into their circle.

290
00:16:03,793 --> 00:16:04,992
They think we simply don't measure up.

291
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:11,033
Fine, I won't tell anyone.

292
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,592
But...

293
00:16:14,193 --> 00:16:16,592
you need to accept yourself and give yourself some credit.

294
00:16:23,953 --> 00:16:24,992
Here.

295
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:26,752
Take it and be proud of it.

296
00:16:27,512 --> 00:16:29,273
Believe me when I say it's impressive.

297
00:16:38,472 --> 00:16:39,512
I'm off.

298
00:17:17,393 --> 00:17:20,433
(CEO Moon Cha Min)

299
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:22,992
I really can't figure out what men want.

300
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:26,752
This is exhausting.

301
00:17:28,032 --> 00:17:29,843
Hey, why aren't you answering? Pick up.

302
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:32,312
(CEO Moon Cha Min)

303
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:36,193
Women don't know what men want.

304
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:37,913
What?

305
00:17:38,072 --> 00:17:39,992
But she's leaving sooner than I thought.

306
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:41,673
It must mean nothing happened, right?

307
00:17:41,913 --> 00:17:44,633
And men don't know what women want.

308
00:17:56,393 --> 00:17:57,393
Here.

309
00:17:57,433 --> 00:17:58,633
Take it and be proud of it.

310
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:00,712
Believe me when I say it's impressive.

311
00:18:33,673 --> 00:18:39,032
("To My Shame")

312
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:44,913
She left pretty quickly, so I'm sure nothing happened.

313
00:18:45,312 --> 00:18:46,603
I mean, I could ask her.

314
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:48,551
"Did you have a good time? Did anything happen?"

315
00:18:48,552 --> 00:18:49,752
Am I being too straightforward?

316
00:18:49,953 --> 00:18:52,123
Gosh, I don't know what to do.

317
00:18:55,153 --> 00:18:57,633
Mr. Moon, why did you get here so early today?

318
00:18:57,992 --> 00:18:59,071
I'm always here early.

319
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,712
- Go and do what you need to do. - Okay.

320
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:03,433
Hello.

321
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:07,031
Hello, Mr. Moon.

322
00:19:07,032 --> 00:19:08,123
- Good morning. - Morning.

323
00:19:13,272 --> 00:19:14,363
Gosh, I'm still full.

324
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:15,992
We need to have a talk later.

325
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,032
Oh, hey.

326
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:21,312
Hello.

327
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:23,393
What?

328
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,123
The members aren't supposed to be here yet.

329
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:30,472
I'm not a regular member.

330
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:34,393
I can come here early to see my fiance.

331
00:19:35,752 --> 00:19:36,792
Gosh.

332
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:48,673
Please join me.

333
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,552
I bet you rarely have breakfast because you're too busy.

334
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:53,792
No, I've eaten. I can't work on an empty stomach.

335
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:55,712
Even so.

336
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:57,673
Have a seat.

337
00:19:58,193 --> 00:19:59,393
I need to talk to you.

338
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:07,673
Okay, go ahead and talk.

339
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:09,843
I heard...

340
00:20:10,393 --> 00:20:13,032
Cha Min crossed the line at the party.

341
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:18,123
I'm sorry. I want to apologize to you on his behalf.

342
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:21,512
No, it's okay.

343
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:22,873
No.

344
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:26,913
The truth is, Cha Min and I made a bet, just for fun.

345
00:20:28,032 --> 00:20:30,311
I told him to help you find a good catch here...

346
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,512
and get married, which is your dream.

347
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,072
Why do you care about me achieving my dream?

348
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:38,312
Well, it's like watching a dating show.

349
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:41,552
I thought it'd provide us with a source of entertainment.

350
00:20:42,072 --> 00:20:44,433
Something interesting to watch, something to gossip about.

351
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:46,433
It's fun, you know?

352
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,363
But I guess Cha Min...

353
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:53,123
stepped in himself because you weren't making any progress...

354
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:54,792
no matter what you tried.

355
00:20:55,363 --> 00:20:57,433
I know it was just a prank, but he shouldn't have done that.

356
00:20:58,873 --> 00:21:00,633
You must've been really offended.

357
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:02,393
I'll scold him harshly.

358
00:21:04,153 --> 00:21:06,153
No, don't scold him.

359
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:08,072
We're all adults here.

360
00:21:08,193 --> 00:21:11,272
We all have to take responsibility for our own actions and feelings.

361
00:21:11,752 --> 00:21:12,953
I'm fine.

362
00:21:15,153 --> 00:21:17,123
He treated you like an attractive toy.

363
00:21:18,512 --> 00:21:19,752
Are you really okay with that?

364
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,363
Who says I'm his toy?

365
00:21:22,232 --> 00:21:23,512
It was fun for me too.

366
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:26,992
The kiss.

367
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:28,913
He's a good kisser.

368
00:21:38,752 --> 00:21:40,272
You went to an omakase restaurant yesterday.

369
00:21:41,232 --> 00:21:42,843
Yes, you should've come with me.

370
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:44,123
It was very good.

371
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:48,232
What about you? What did you have after ditching me yesterday?

372
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:49,472
Sweet potatoes.

373
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,193
I had sweet potatoes yesterday.

374
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:53,913
Mr. Moon, are you playing favorites here?

375
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:55,433
What about me?

376
00:21:55,512 --> 00:21:57,232
Okay. You can go wine and dine too.

377
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:59,232
I'll just keep eating sweet potatoes.

378
00:22:02,193 --> 00:22:03,272
You guys look so excited.

379
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,272
Dan A.

380
00:22:22,193 --> 00:22:24,673
You must be graceful and elegant at all times.

381
00:22:25,752 --> 00:22:26,992
Chanel.

382
00:22:28,072 --> 00:22:29,353
Dior.

383
00:22:29,712 --> 00:22:31,032
Louis Vuitton.

384
00:22:31,272 --> 00:22:32,433
Gucci.

385
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:33,593
Burberry.

386
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:39,153
The kiss.

387
00:22:39,953 --> 00:22:42,953
He's a good kisser.

388
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:45,433
Prada!

389
00:22:55,113 --> 00:22:56,153
You know the answer very well.

390
00:22:56,913 --> 00:22:58,153
They normally don't...

391
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:00,393
accept people like us into their circle.

392
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,472
He treated you like an attractive toy.

393
00:23:03,752 --> 00:23:05,153
Are you really okay with that?

394
00:23:06,113 --> 00:23:08,673
So, he's toying with me.

395
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:16,633
Who boils water until it bubbles up to make tea?

396
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:18,752
Are you going to have ramyeon?

397
00:23:20,752 --> 00:23:23,153
Hey, why do you seem so down?

398
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:27,072
Did something happen at Baek Ddong's studio?

399
00:23:27,512 --> 00:23:29,393
- Tell me. - Why should I tell you?

400
00:23:30,593 --> 00:23:33,472
Why should I tell my boss about meeting a man on my day off?

401
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:41,752
Why not? I'm not supposed to know?

402
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:45,232
Do you find me that amusing?

403
00:23:46,153 --> 00:23:48,433
But you know what? This isn't fun for me.

404
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:50,353
I'm flustered and confused.

405
00:23:51,153 --> 00:23:52,673
Do you think I'm a big joke?

406
00:23:53,752 --> 00:23:54,752
No.

407
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:57,873
You're fun, and I enjoy spending time with you,

408
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:00,152
but I don't think you're a joke.

409
00:24:00,153 --> 00:24:02,593
Yes, you do think I'm a joke.

410
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:05,992
You kissed me. Then you said you were my Fairy Godmother.

411
00:24:06,193 --> 00:24:08,592
You sent me to another man and asked me what I did with him...

412
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:09,712
because you're toying with me.

413
00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:12,673
What about it?

414
00:24:14,232 --> 00:24:15,272
You didn't like it?

415
00:24:18,232 --> 00:24:20,393
You said you put your personal gains before your pride.

416
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,232
So I thought...

417
00:24:23,873 --> 00:24:25,593
it was the best thing for your sake.

418
00:24:27,712 --> 00:24:29,232
You're incredibly rude.

419
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:32,912
Did you do it because you thought you could treat me like that?

420
00:24:32,913 --> 00:24:33,992
No, it's not like that.

421
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:36,312
I...

422
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:39,312
just wanted to help you,

423
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:42,593
but I guess I wasn't thoughtful enough.

424
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,752
- I'm sorry. - Forget it.

425
00:24:47,072 --> 00:24:48,112
From now on,

426
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,232
I must decline your kind gestures which are just selfish gimmicks.

427
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:51,833
So,

428
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:54,873
even if I date a jerk or get dumped by a scumbag,

429
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,393
stay completely out of my personal business.

430
00:24:59,393 --> 00:25:00,552
It offends me.

431
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:19,711
Hey, Dae Bong.

432
00:25:19,712 --> 00:25:21,872
This is our first time doing this after we left the field years ago.

433
00:25:21,873 --> 00:25:23,393
My goodness. I know.

434
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:24,913
I'm so excited that I feel like I can fly.

435
00:25:25,953 --> 00:25:27,833
You're obese, so you can't fly.

436
00:25:28,072 --> 00:25:29,833
Why, you little...

437
00:25:30,913 --> 00:25:32,393
Anyway, today...

438
00:25:32,712 --> 00:25:34,832
We'll just suss out the situation quickly and leave.

439
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,032
- Got it. - Good.

440
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,031
(Niece Dan A)

441
00:25:44,032 --> 00:25:45,311
Oh, it's Dan A.

442
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:46,393
(Niece Dan A)

443
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,232
- Hey. - I'm...

444
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,512
fuming mad right now because of Shin Jae Rim.

445
00:25:52,992 --> 00:25:55,633
Go to Mont Chant Claire and pick up some bread for me.

446
00:25:56,232 --> 00:25:57,433
Bring it to me while it's still warm!

447
00:25:59,312 --> 00:26:00,832
Goodness, that temper of hers.

448
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:03,551
How could we get home from Namsan while the bread is still warm?

449
00:26:03,552 --> 00:26:05,113
It means she just wants to lash out at us.

450
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:06,472
Gosh.

451
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:09,113
Then let's just go and pick up the bread for her.

452
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:12,153
Hey! So Bong. We're Dan A's uncles.

453
00:26:12,552 --> 00:26:14,633
I know you adore her, but will you let her boss you around forever?

454
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,433
Even when you're 60?

455
00:26:17,393 --> 00:26:19,593
You're her uncle and an adult, so act as such.

456
00:26:20,673 --> 00:26:21,953
Let's just catch that girl today.

457
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:25,953
Oh, my. Dae Bong, you're so wise.

458
00:26:26,193 --> 00:26:27,913
You're as wise as Confucius.

459
00:26:29,072 --> 00:26:30,271
- Hey, So Bong. - Yes.

460
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,393
You brought the tools, right?

461
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,153
- I sure did. - Good.

462
00:26:44,712 --> 00:26:47,153
- It's your first time here, right? - Yes.

463
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:48,953
How may I help you?

464
00:26:49,752 --> 00:26:53,153
My honey says her stomach is upset.

465
00:26:53,393 --> 00:26:55,272
Could she use the restroom here?

466
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,232
- The restroom? - Yes.

467
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,913
But it's not a public restroom.

468
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:05,393
My goodness. How mean!

469
00:27:05,712 --> 00:27:09,272
Do you have to poop gold to use the restroom here or something?

470
00:27:09,472 --> 00:27:10,792
Why won't you let us use it?

471
00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:14,472
Well, you're right.

472
00:27:15,393 --> 00:27:17,472
Please go ahead and use the restroom. It's this way.

473
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:21,192
Babe, go and poop.

474
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:22,353
Okay, babe.

475
00:27:26,072 --> 00:27:27,552
Jae Rim. Come here for a second.

476
00:27:32,873 --> 00:27:34,393
Jung Ja is looking for you.

477
00:27:36,712 --> 00:27:37,873
Babe, let's just go.

478
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:41,593
Sorry. She's very selective as to where she poops.

479
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:42,873
We'll be leaving, then.

480
00:27:48,873 --> 00:27:51,552
Hey, Sun Jung. I just got off work.

481
00:27:52,072 --> 00:27:53,873
I'll be there shortly, so go ahead and order. With bones.

482
00:27:54,232 --> 00:27:56,752
I need to chew up something right now.

483
00:27:57,113 --> 00:27:58,113
All right.

484
00:28:10,712 --> 00:28:11,712
What is this?

485
00:28:12,072 --> 00:28:13,393
Do you know about spiritual training?

486
00:28:15,913 --> 00:28:17,072
What about it?

487
00:28:18,752 --> 00:28:21,232
We've been training ourselves spiritually in Mount Inwang,

488
00:28:21,472 --> 00:28:23,072
so we see some things that others don't.

489
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:27,832
Your ancestors are very angry right now.

490
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,633
- That's right. - Yes.

491
00:28:29,712 --> 00:28:32,152
They're fuming mad now, aren't they?

492
00:28:32,153 --> 00:28:33,791
- Yes. - Yes, they are.

493
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:35,992
That said, please come with us.

494
00:28:36,072 --> 00:28:37,832
Our positive energy will help you...

495
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:40,912
You guys are the reason my ancestors are fuming mad.

496
00:28:40,913 --> 00:28:44,552
They say you'll get struck by lightning unless you get lost now.

497
00:28:44,673 --> 00:28:46,751
Goodness. Hey, miss.

498
00:28:46,752 --> 00:28:48,873
You have quite a temper. Who do you take after?

499
00:28:49,032 --> 00:28:51,633
I guess we can't get you to come with us by talking nicely.

500
00:28:51,673 --> 00:28:53,231
- Hey, put her in the car. - Okay!

501
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,512
- Come with us. Come on! - What are you doing? My gosh!

502
00:28:55,593 --> 00:28:57,192
- Do you think I'll let you? - Come on. Let's go.

503
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,193
- What is this? - Get this!

504
00:28:58,593 --> 00:28:59,593
Hey, what is this?

505
00:29:03,153 --> 00:29:05,833
My goodness. Hey, you did this to yourself.

506
00:29:05,873 --> 00:29:07,393
Gosh, you're dumb.

507
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:08,552
- Hey, lift her. - Okay.

508
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:10,872
- No! Please spare me. - Goodness.

509
00:29:10,873 --> 00:29:12,633
- Spare me, please! - Hey, come on.

510
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,873
You did it to yourself. Goodness.

511
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:16,552
Go in!

512
00:29:23,113 --> 00:29:25,193
The person you have reached is unavailable. Please leave...

513
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:27,032
Why isn't she answering?

514
00:29:28,992 --> 00:29:30,792
What's taking her so long?

515
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:52,032
Oh, we're closed now.

516
00:29:52,393 --> 00:29:53,552
I see.

517
00:29:54,072 --> 00:29:57,113
By any chance, do you know if Shin Jae Rim is still here?

518
00:29:57,512 --> 00:29:59,032
- Shin Jae Rim? - Yes.

519
00:29:59,272 --> 00:30:01,113
I'm Jae Rim's friend.

520
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,633
Are you the CEO?

521
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:10,113
How did you know?

522
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,353
You ooze so much charisma.

523
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:15,712
It says all over your face that you're the CEO.

524
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:17,512
And Jae Rim told me...

525
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:20,593
that the CEO was young, rich, tall, handsome,

526
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:22,393
sexy, and cute.

527
00:30:23,472 --> 00:30:24,472
No way.

528
00:30:25,312 --> 00:30:26,992
Anyway, Jae Rim left. She's not here now.

529
00:30:27,272 --> 00:30:28,353
Right?

530
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:30,792
She said she'd meet me right after work,

531
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,512
but I suddenly couldn't reach her.

532
00:30:33,113 --> 00:30:34,272
I wonder if something happened.

533
00:30:35,953 --> 00:30:39,193
So, stay completely out of my personal business.

534
00:30:42,353 --> 00:30:43,353
Okay, what about it?

535
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,433
It's none of my business.

536
00:30:49,752 --> 00:30:51,472
Please don't kill me.

537
00:30:52,072 --> 00:30:53,193
Please spare me.

538
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:03,633
Misters.

539
00:31:04,393 --> 00:31:07,311
You see, I don't have parents.

540
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:08,711
I don't even have a husband. I have nothing,

541
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:10,393
so you won't get a single penny out of me.

542
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:13,071
So instead of wasting your precious time,

543
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:15,272
could you please let me go?

544
00:31:15,552 --> 00:31:17,512
Well, the market is pretty good these days,

545
00:31:17,673 --> 00:31:19,072
so you can make money by selling your organs.

546
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:20,752
Sir, please!

547
00:31:21,072 --> 00:31:23,633
I've been drinking too often, so my organs aren't healthy.

548
00:31:23,712 --> 00:31:25,352
I'll take better care of my health,

549
00:31:25,353 --> 00:31:26,912
so can't you come back for me later on?

550
00:31:26,913 --> 00:31:29,872
Oh, boy. You don't need to worry about that.

551
00:31:29,873 --> 00:31:32,032
We don't intend to extort money from you.

552
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:37,232
It's simple. A bloody revenge is what we want.

553
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,873
That's why we brought you here.

554
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:40,833
- "Revenge?" - That's right.

555
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:44,512
I've never done anything bad enough to deserve this...

556
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:48,192
No, sorry! Forgive me. Please?

557
00:31:48,193 --> 00:31:50,873
No can do. You did something very bad.

558
00:31:51,353 --> 00:31:52,393
What should we do, Dae Bong?

559
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:54,552
Well, I wonder too.

560
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,472
It's been too long, so I'm not quite sure either.

561
00:32:01,113 --> 00:32:02,113
Oh, boy.

562
00:32:02,992 --> 00:32:05,833
I used my brain today for a change, so I'm hungry.

563
00:32:06,032 --> 00:32:07,311
Shall we order jjajangmyeon?

564
00:32:07,312 --> 00:32:09,072
You idiot.

565
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,593
Use your brain, will you?

566
00:32:11,153 --> 00:32:12,511
If we get it delivered here,

567
00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:14,953
and if the righteous delivery guy calls the police, then what?

568
00:32:16,113 --> 00:32:17,953
Can you not think?

569
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:24,272
We should go there and eat it.

570
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,393
My gosh, Dae Bong. Even though you left the field long ago,

571
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,272
- but you've still got it. - I know.

572
00:32:34,673 --> 00:32:36,153
You're a genius thug.

573
00:32:36,512 --> 00:32:37,673
- Let's go! - Okay.

574
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:39,633
Hey, you'd better stay quiet.

575
00:32:43,552 --> 00:32:45,953
What? They're stepping out?

576
00:32:50,712 --> 00:32:51,712
They left?

577
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,113
My gosh.

578
00:32:56,113 --> 00:32:58,232
Gosh, what do I do now?

579
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:03,032
It hurts.

580
00:33:03,992 --> 00:33:06,873
However, even Dae Bong, the genius thug,

581
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:10,113
should've been thoughtful enough.

582
00:33:10,472 --> 00:33:11,552
Hi, Bixby.

583
00:33:14,232 --> 00:33:15,433
Hi, Bixby?

584
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:17,833
- Yes. - My gosh!

585
00:33:18,272 --> 00:33:19,792
Call 112.

586
00:33:20,193 --> 00:33:22,472
I did not understand what you said.

587
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,792
The police. Call the police.

588
00:33:25,393 --> 00:33:28,072
Can you try to pronounce the words more clearly?

589
00:33:28,312 --> 00:33:31,153
Call 112.

590
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,232
Please say it again.

591
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:34,633
Hey, seriously!

592
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:37,312
I asked you to make a call. Why are you so useless?

593
00:33:37,353 --> 00:33:39,712
Just make a call!

594
00:33:41,072 --> 00:33:42,673
Okay, missed calls.

595
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:46,472
Calling "Useless Friend No Sun Jung."

596
00:33:49,512 --> 00:33:51,032
Gosh, Shin Jae Rim.

597
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:53,232
What is she up to now?

598
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:55,953
She bailed on her friend.

599
00:34:02,232 --> 00:34:05,833
I can't believe I'm playing Jenga with someone I just met.

600
00:34:06,873 --> 00:34:07,992
There's nothing like Jenga to break the ice.

601
00:34:08,992 --> 00:34:09,992
Right?

602
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:11,632
Then next time,

603
00:34:12,112 --> 00:34:14,592
we can play together all night.

604
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:16,192
You know what I mean.

605
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:22,282
By the way, do you mind putting your phone on the table?

606
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:24,433
My phone? Why?

607
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:25,953
When we're playing a game like this,

608
00:34:26,192 --> 00:34:28,722
we should keep checking the time.

609
00:34:30,282 --> 00:34:31,313
You're right.

610
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:34,722
Otherwise, we'll easily lose track of time.

611
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:42,472
(Drunkard Jae Rim)

612
00:34:44,512 --> 00:34:45,512
What?

613
00:34:46,353 --> 00:34:47,353
Hello?

614
00:34:47,393 --> 00:34:48,912
Sun Jung!

615
00:34:48,913 --> 00:34:50,991
I've been kidnapped.

616
00:34:50,992 --> 00:34:52,353
"Kidnapped?" What do you mean?

617
00:34:53,313 --> 00:34:54,721
Did you fall for a vishing call?

618
00:34:54,722 --> 00:34:55,761
No!

619
00:34:55,762 --> 00:34:57,313
Hey, Shin Jae Rim. Where are you?

620
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,762
If I knew that, this wouldn't be considered kidnapping.

621
00:35:00,762 --> 00:35:02,792
Hurry up and find me!

622
00:35:02,793 --> 00:35:04,433
Calm down and tell me anything you know.

623
00:35:05,632 --> 00:35:07,032
I promise I'll find you.

624
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:12,393
I'm at a derelict factory that smells like makgeolli.

625
00:35:23,552 --> 00:35:24,722
Please let me go!

626
00:35:25,152 --> 00:35:27,471
I want to go home!

627
00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:28,512
I'm scared.

628
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:35,112
Shin Jae Rim, please.

629
00:35:36,152 --> 00:35:37,152
Please be safe.

630
00:35:42,762 --> 00:35:43,873
My goodness.

631
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:46,913
I heard you'd been hitting on Moon, my nephew-in-law.

632
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,512
You've been recklessly wagging your tail at him,

633
00:35:49,672 --> 00:35:51,833
so we are going to cut your tail off.

634
00:35:52,592 --> 00:35:53,632
"Moon?"

635
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:55,913
- You mean Mr. Moon, my boss? - That's right.

636
00:35:56,552 --> 00:35:57,793
No, that's not true!

637
00:35:58,192 --> 00:36:00,192
Also, I do not have a tail.

638
00:36:00,913 --> 00:36:02,312
- You don't? - I must say,

639
00:36:02,313 --> 00:36:03,762
she doesn't have the face for it.

640
00:36:04,072 --> 00:36:05,241
Did we catch the wrong girl?

641
00:36:05,242 --> 00:36:06,672
No, we didn't.

642
00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:09,873
The most famous femme fatales...

643
00:36:10,393 --> 00:36:12,512
are all ugly. Yes.

644
00:36:13,032 --> 00:36:14,872
Are you criticizing my looks right now?

645
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,112
My goodness.

646
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:18,472
You're getting all worked up because we called you ugly.

647
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:21,552
Why? Did you spend a lot of money on your face?

648
00:36:21,672 --> 00:36:24,393
Our niece, Dan A, has spent way more, so know your place.

649
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:26,393
Oh, dear.

650
00:36:26,512 --> 00:36:28,722
That young girl wanted to be pretty,

651
00:36:29,873 --> 00:36:31,511
so she got plastic surgery on her face...

652
00:36:31,512 --> 00:36:32,592
that looked like a white potato.

653
00:36:33,793 --> 00:36:36,353
Then began the war on puffiness.

654
00:36:37,512 --> 00:36:39,953
We boiled red beans 24-7 to make red bean tea for her...

655
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:42,112
and woke her up when she fell asleep.

656
00:36:42,762 --> 00:36:46,353
I miss her old face from time to time but can't see it anymore.

657
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:49,913
We worked so hard to raise her...

658
00:36:50,152 --> 00:36:52,242
and want to marry her off now,

659
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,192
so how dare you try to seduce our future nephew-in-law?

660
00:36:55,552 --> 00:36:56,672
And you're ugly.

661
00:36:58,672 --> 00:37:00,793
How could I not be upset about this situation?

662
00:37:01,472 --> 00:37:04,551
Then take it up with Mr. Moon instead of doing this to me.

663
00:37:04,552 --> 00:37:05,552
No, we can't do that!

664
00:37:06,632 --> 00:37:09,313
If we do that, Dan A will kill us for sure.

665
00:37:09,552 --> 00:37:11,592
In any case, you are falsely accusing me.

666
00:37:11,722 --> 00:37:12,722
Let me go!

667
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:15,032
If you want us to release you,

668
00:37:16,632 --> 00:37:19,671
write here that you will leave Chungdam Heaven...

669
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:21,072
and sign it.

670
00:37:22,672 --> 00:37:24,913
It's so hard to get a job these days.

671
00:37:25,313 --> 00:37:26,873
That's like telling me to die. I refuse!

672
00:37:29,512 --> 00:37:31,512
Let's make sure she can never walk around with her head held up again.

673
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,722
Rude brats like her...

674
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,282
should be taught to bow down by getting their head shaved.

675
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:39,992
Oh, no! Wait!

676
00:37:40,282 --> 00:37:42,313
My goal is to get married this year.

677
00:37:42,722 --> 00:37:44,833
I can't get married with a shaved head.

678
00:37:45,992 --> 00:37:48,032
If I wear a tiara on my shaved head,

679
00:37:48,072 --> 00:37:50,072
I will look like Xuanzang, the monk.

680
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:54,282
We'll make sure it looks nice.

681
00:37:58,762 --> 00:38:01,393
No, please. No!

682
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:04,552
Okay! I'll do it. I'll sign it.

683
00:38:04,722 --> 00:38:05,722
Good!

684
00:38:10,953 --> 00:38:11,953
What's that?

685
00:38:13,762 --> 00:38:14,762
Who's that punk?

686
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,632
He's our future nephew-in-law.

687
00:38:30,913 --> 00:38:32,632
- Oh, then what do we do? - It's fine.

688
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:34,552
He doesn't know who we are anyway.

689
00:38:35,762 --> 00:38:37,072
We'll just keep playing dumb.

690
00:38:37,953 --> 00:38:39,512
- Make him pass out. - Okay.

691
00:38:59,282 --> 00:39:00,313
My goodness.

692
00:39:00,793 --> 00:39:02,242
Don't be ridiculous.

693
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:08,242
Dae Bong, don't underestimate him...

694
00:39:39,472 --> 00:39:40,793
I was worried sick.
